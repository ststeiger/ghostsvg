<h1><img src="../pics/gsview2.gif" alt=""> GSview BETA</h1>
<p>
The latest release version is <a href="get34.html">GSview 3.4</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are no beta versions of GSview currently available.
</p>
<p>
GSview 3.32 alpha test is available as source code, Win32 binary and
<b>Linux/X11</b> binary.
The version numbering is confusing.  Version 3.32 is later code
than 3.4.
</p>
<p>
GSview 3.32 alpha can be found in 
<tt>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/beta/">
ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/beta/
</a>
</tt>
</p>

<h2>X11</h2>
<p>
These are some notes on the current state of X11 GSview.
</p>
<p>
This is alpha code.  
X11 GSview is written by a novice at X Windows programming.
It might have serious problems.  
The GTK+ toolkit is used for most of the graphical interface,
with a small amount of Xlib for interfacing with Ghostscript.
</p>

<h3>
Compilation
</h3>
To compile GSview for Linux/X11 you need gcc and the GTK+ 1.2 toolkit.
Unzip the gsv331src.zip, to produce three other zip files.
Unzip these, converting the line endings:
<br><tt>unzip -a src.zip</tt>
<br>
Change to the <tt>src</tt> subdirectory and copy 
<tt>gvx.mak</tt> to <tt>makefile</tt>.
Run <tt>make</tt>.
To install, run <tt>make install</tt>
</p>

<h3>
Installation
</h3>
<p>
Copy <tt>gsview</tt> to a directory on your search path.
Copy <tt>gvxen.htm</tt>, <tt>gvxfr.htm</tt> and <tt>printer.ini</tt> 
to <tt>/usr/share/gsview</tt>.
GSview stores configuration information in <tt>$HOME/.gsviewrc</tt>.
</p>

<h3>
Unimplemented features
</h3>
<p>
Highest priority first
</p>
<ul>
<li> Many accelerator keys don't work.
      The GtkItemFactory ignores some accelerators, including
      '+', '-', ',', '.', ' ', '\h'.
<li> Help uses HTML and netscape.
    Gnome Help Browser is not used because it doesn't
    support #topic on the command line.  For example:
      gnome-help-browser file:/path/gsview.htm#Page_Size
    If you know of a way to tell the Gnome Help Browser to
    jump to a particular topic, particularly without opening
    another copy of the browser, please let me know.
<li> Keyboard movement between widgets
<li> Convert to vector format
<li> Full screen not implemented.
<li> Clipboard operations
<li> Sounds
</ul>
<p>

<h3>
Known problems
</h3>
<ul>
<li> "Media | Display Settings | Draw Method" should be set
   to pixmap (the default) or backing pixmap.  The setting
   backing storage doesn't work properly - it does draw, 
   but my X server is ignoring the request to provide
   backing storage for the window.  I don't know if other
   X servers will behave the same way.
<li> Fit window doesn't get the correct dimension of the scrolled window
     client area, so the resize is slightly wrong.
   At the moment we use the size of the scroll window less the two
   two scroll bars.
<li> GSview still includes lots of debugging code.
</ul>

<h3>
Requests
</h3>
<p>
Suggestions from GTK+ programmers about how to improve GSview.
</p>
<p>
Bug reports.  Use "gsview -d9" to get debugging messages on stdout.
