<H1><A NAME="1">Overview</A></H1>
<B>GSview</B> is a graphical interface for Ghostscript under MS-Windows 
or OS/2. 
Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript page description language 
used by laser printers. 
For documents following the Adobe PostScript Document Structuring 
Conventions, GSview allows selected pages to be viewed or printed. 
GSview 3.4 requires Ghostscript 4.03 - 6.99, 
preferably 6.0 or later.

It is recommended that you use the installation program for 
installing GSview. 
This is called <B>setup.exe</B> for MS-Windows and <B>os2setup.exe</B> for OS/2. 
GSview for MS-Windows is distributed in a self extracting archive - 
running this will run the setup program. 
You will need to install Ghostscript separately. 
<P>If you wish to install GSview manually, see the <A HREF="#73">Manual Installation</A> 
topic. 
<P>Configuration will occur the first time GSview is run. 
If you want to change the configuration later, use 
<A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1213">Easy Configure</A> or 
<A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1226">Advanced Configure</A>.

<H2><A NAME="42">Uninstalling GSview</A></H2>
To uninstall GSview from Windows 95 or NT 4.0, 
use <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> from the Windows <B>Control Panel</B>. 
<P>
<A HREF="#46">Manual uninstallation</A><BR>

<H3><A NAME="46">Manual uninstallation</A></H3>
To uninstall GSview, remove the files in the <B>gsview </B> directory. 
<P>Also remove 
<PRE>
 c:\windows\gsview32.ini
</PRE>
<P>from the appropriate system directory. 
For Windows NT you may also need to remove gsview32.ini 
from user profile directories. 
<P>Remove the <B>Ghostgum</B> group from the Program Manager or Start menu 
<P>If you know how to edit the registry, remove the following keys: 
<PRE>
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\psfile
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.eps
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ps
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/postscript
</PRE>
<P>If you associated PDF with GSview you will also need to remove 
<PRE>
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdffile
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pdf
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/pdf
</PRE>
<P>The preferred method to uninstall Ghostscript is 
using <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> from the Windows <B>Control Panel</B>. 
To manually uninstall Ghostscript, remove the files in the <B>gsN.NN</B> 
directory where N.NN is the version number of Ghostscript. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="73">Manual Installation</A></H2>
It is recommended that you use the installation program for installing 
GSview.  The following instructions describe how to install GSview 
without using the installation program. 
<P>Set the environment variable TEMP to point to a directory for 
temporary files.  For example: 
<PRE>
  SET TEMP=c:\temp
</PRE>
<P>The directory must exist and must be writeable. 
<P>First you need to install Ghostscript, plus its library files and fonts. 
You need the Ghostscript version listed in <A HREF="#1">Overview</A>. 
This version of GSview will not work with other versions of Ghostscript. 
Install Ghostscript in a directory c:\Aladdin\gsN.NN 
(Replace N.NN by the Ghostscript version number.) 
<P>Make a directory c:\ghostgum\gsview 
<P>Next install 
GSview for Windows by copying gsview32.exe, gsv16spl.exe, gvwgs32.exe, 
gsvw32de.dll, gsvw32es.dll, gsvw32fr.dll, gsvw32it.dll, 
gsviewen.hlp, gsviewde.hlp, gsviewes.hlp, gsviewfr.hlp, gsviewit.hlp 
and printer.ini 
to the <B>c:\ghostgum\gsview</B> directory. 
<P>Start GSview and select the appropriate version of Ghostscript 
(usually the latest).  To change this later, use 
<A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1213">Easy Configure</A>. 
<P>For more control over configuration, see <A HREF="#104">Advanced Manual Installation</A>. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="104">Advanced Manual Installation</A></H2>
Instead of using <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1213">Easy Configure</A>, use 
<A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1226">Advanced Configure</A>. 
<P>First correctly set the three text fields (see <A HREF="#1226">Advanced Configure</A>). 
<P>On the <A HREF="#1226">Advanced Configure</A> dialog, either select the checkboxes 
<B>Copy printer defaults</B>, <B>Associate .ps files with GSview</B> and 
<B>Create Start Menu items</B>, or perform the following three steps. 
<P>1. Exit GSview, then append printer.ini to the GSview INI file 
(c:\windows\gsview32.ini or c:\os2\gvpm.ini) 
<P>2. Add the .ps and .eps (and optionally the .pdf) file types to 
the <A HREF="#191">Registry</A>. 
<P>3. Create a Program Manager or Start Menu item for GSview. 
<P>If you have some Type 1 fonts on your system, it may be possible to 
tell Ghostscript to use them.  See <B>Fontmap.os2</B> and <B>Fontmap.atm</B> 
supplied with Ghostscript for examples.  See the <B>Fonts</B> topic. 
<P>If you have problems, try reading the help topic <A HREF="#1871">Common Problems</A>.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="128">Network Installation</A></H2>
Install GSview to a network directory. 
<P>When a user starts GSview for the first time, or starts GSview 
after the version number has changed, GSview will configure 
the local computer. 
<P>Using a UNC path when installing GSview will not work 
from Windows 3.1, but does work from Windows 95. 
<P>GSview tries to maintain one configuration file for each user. 
If user profiles are being used under Windows 95 or NT, 
GSview will store the INI file in the user profile directory, 
as specified in the registry.  If this can't be found, 
and the environment variable USERPROFILE is defined and is 
a directory, GSview will store the INI file in this directory. 
If this fails, GSview will store the INI file in the default 
location, the Windows directory. 
If the user profile directory exists, but is write protected, 
GSview will have trouble. 
<P>If you wish to stop GSview from displaying the <A HREF="#1213">Easy Configure</A> 
when GSview is first run, or whenever GSview is upgraded, 
place an INI file in the GSview directory. 
<B>Remember to remove this file before upgrading GSview in the future.</B> 
This should contain only those entries that you wish to overwrite 
in the users configuration. 
The suggested technique is to install GSview, then configure it. 
Copy gsview32.ini or gvpm.ini from the system directory or your 
user profile directory to the GSview directory, then edit it to 
remove all entries except for: 
<PRE>
 [Options]
 Version=3.4
 GSversion=601
 Configured=1
 GhostscriptDLL=e:\Aladdin\gs6.01\bin\gsdll32.dll
 GhostscriptInclude=e:\Aladdin\gs6.01\lib;e:\Aladdin\fonts
 GhostscriptOther=-dNOPLATFONTS -sFONTPATH="c:\psfonts"
</PRE>
<P>When a user starts GSview, their INI file will normally be used. 
The first time GSview is run, or when the GSview version doesn't 
match the INI file, the following will occur: 
<P>1. The INI file in the GSview directory will be read, overriding 
the users INI file. 
<P>2. The list of printers will be updated from printer.ini in 
the GSview directory. 
<P>3. File associations (.ps, .eps, .pdf) will NOT be made or changed. 
If you wish to change these you must use <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1226">Advanced Configure</A>. 
<P>4. Program Manager groups / Start menu items / Program objects 
will NOT be changed. 
If you wish to change these you must use <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1226">Advanced Configure</A>. 
<P>If a user tries to use the GSview uninstall program, it will 
try to delete the GSview and Ghostscript files on the network. 
Make sure the GSview and Ghostscript directories are not writeable 
by users. 
To be extra safe, you may wish to remove the file <B>uninstal.txt</B> from 
the GSview directory. 
<P>

<H2><A NAME="191">Running GSview from the File Manager or Windows Explorer</A></H2>
If you used the GSview setup.exe program and answered <B>yes</B> to 
all the questions, the following configuration has already occurred. 
If you didn't update the registry during GSview installation, 
the following information explains how to do it manually. 
<P>To run GSview when a PostScript file is double clicked in the 
File Manager, the following sequence must be followed to teach 
File Manager about PostScript files. 
<P>From the <B>Program Manager</B>, run the Registration Info Editor using 
<B>File </B>| <B>Run...</B> then type <B>regedit</B>. 
From the <B>Registration Info Editor</B> select <B>Edit </B>| <B>Add File Type...</B> 
then enter the following fields: 
<PRE>
 Identifier = psfile
 Filetype = PostScript
 Action = Open
 Command = c:\ghostgum\gsview\gsview32 %1
 Uses DDE = unchecked
 Action = Print
 Command = c:\ghostgum\gsview\gsview32 /p %1
 Uses DDE = unchecked
</PRE>
<P>Then press <B>OK</B>. 
<P>From the <B>File Manager</B>, select <B>File </B>| <B>Associate</B> then 
enter the following fields: 
<PRE>
 Files with Extension = ps
 Associate With = PostScript (gsview)
</PRE>
<P>Then press <B>OK</B>. 
<P>That's it!  Now when you double click on a PostScript file, 
the <B>File Manager</B> will run GSview.  When you drop a PostScript 
file on the <B>Print Manager</B>, GSview will print the file. 
If you have a PostScript printer, this won't be useful. 
In this case you will need to remove the Print action from 
the registry. 
<P>For Windows 95, the configuration is instead made using Windows 
Explorer. 
<P>Start <B>Windows Explorer</B>.  Select <B>View </B>| <B>Options </B>.  Select the 
<B>File Types</B> tab.  Select the <B>New Type</B> button. 
Enter the following fields: 
<PRE>
 Description of type = PostScript
 Associated Extension = PS EPS
</PRE>
<P>Press the <B>New</B> button, then enter 
<PRE>
 Action = open
 Application used to perform action = c:\ghostgum\gsview\gsview32.exe
</PRE>
<P>Press the <B>OK</B> button 
<P>Press the <B>New</B> button, then enter 
<PRE>
 Action = print
 Application used to perform action = c:\ghostgum\gsview\gsview32.exe /p
</PRE>
<P>Press the <B>OK</B> button 
<P>Press the <B>Close </B>button.

<H1><A NAME="269">Document Structuring Conventions</A></H1>
Adobe has defined a set of extended comment conventions that provide 
additional information about the page structure and resource 
requirements of a PostScript file. 
If a file contains these Document Structuring Convention (DSC) comments, 
GSview can display pages in random order using <A HREF="#401">Goto Page</A> and display pages 
in reverse order using <A HREF="#401">Previous Page</A>.  Selected pages can be extracted to 
another file or printed. 
<P>If a file does not contain DSC comments, GSview can only 
display the pages in the original order. 
<P>DSC conforming files start with the comment line: 
<PRE>
 %!PS-Adobe-3.0
</PRE>
<P>where the number 3.0 may change and is the DSC version number. 
Some programs write PostScript files with a control-D as the first 
character of the file, followed by the comment line mentioned above. 
GSview will correctly report that these files are not DSC conforming, 
but will still display them with page selection features available. 
Complain to the author of the program that produced the PostScript file. 
To make the file DSC conforming, edit it to remove the control-D character. 
<P>DSC conforming files contain lines such as: 
<PRE>
 %%Pages: 24
 %%Page: 1 1
</PRE>
<P>These lines tell GSview how many pages a document contains and 
where they start.  GSview uses this information to select 
individual pages. 
<P>Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPSF) are single page documents 
that contain a subset of the <B>DSC</B> comments and PostScript commands. 
EPS files start with the comment line: 
<PRE>
 %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
</PRE>
<P>EPS files are commonly used for inclusion in other documents and 
for this reason require the bounding box comment: 
<PRE>
  %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury
</PRE>
<P>where llx, lly, urx and ury are integers giving the x and y co-ordinates 
of the lower left and upper right corners of a bounding box which encloses 
all marks made on the page. 
<P>Some EPS files contain a preview of the PostScript document. 
This preview can be a Windows Metafile, a TIFF file, or an Interchange 
preview (EPSI format). 
For the Windows Metafile or TIFF file preview, the EPS file under DOS 
contains a binary header which specifies the location and lengths of 
the preview and PostScript language sections of the EPS file. 
For the Interchange format, the preview is contained in DSC comments 
starting with 
<PRE>
 %%BeginPreview: width height depth lines
</PRE>
<P>An EPS file with a preview can be created from an EPS file without a 
preview using <A HREF="#908">Add EPS Preview</A>. 
<P>GSview may give warnings when documents contain incorrect DSC 
comments.  This can be changed with <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1342">DSC Warnings</A>. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="328">Portable Document Format</A></H1>
GSview can display and print PDF files, although there are a number 
of limitations with the current method. 
<P>When displaying, GSview ignores the page size on the Media menu, 
and instead uses the /MediaBox from the PDF file. 
If <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1497">EPS Clip</A> is enabled, GSview will use the /CropBox 
from the PDF file. 
<P>GSview needs to <A HREF="#363">Open</A> a PDF file to count the pages.  If you 
<B>Select</B> the file, GSview will not be able to <A HREF="#1038">Text Extract</A>, 
<A HREF="#1038">Find</A>, <A HREF="#401">Goto Page</A> or do any other operation that needs to know 
how many pages are in the document. 
<P>pdfmark link support is crude. 
<P>To convert a PostScript file to a PDF file, use <A HREF="#363">File</A> | <A HREF="#790">Convert</A>, 
then select the <B>pdfwrite</B> device. 
<P>To convert a PDF file to a PostScript file, use <A HREF="#363">File</A> | <A HREF="#790">Convert</A>, 
then select the <B>pswrite</B> device. 
<P><A HREF="#363">File</A> | <A HREF="#820">Extract</A> does not work for PDF files. 
Extracting PDF pages extracts PostScript rather than PDF. 
<P>To batch convert multiple files, look at ps2pdf.bat and pdf2ps.bat 
in the Ghostscript directory. 
You will need to use 
gswin32c.exe 
instead of gs.exe.  You may also need to set the Ghostscript 
include path using <B>-I</B> or the environment variable <B>GS_LIB</B>. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="363">Opening a Document</A></H1>
The <B>Open</B> command on the <B>File</B> menu opens a file and displays 
the first page. 
<P>If the file contains <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments, pages can be selected using 
<A HREF="#401">Next Page</A>, <A HREF="#401">Previous Page</A> and <A HREF="#401">Goto Page</A>. 
<P>If the file does not contain <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments, <A HREF="#401">Previous Page</A> and <A HREF="#401">Goto Page</A> 
will not work.  Another file should not be selected until a last page of 
the file has been displayed. 
<P>When a file is open, GSview will display the document filename, 
the current page (if available) and while the cursor is over 
the image, the location of the cursor in co-ordinates specified 
by <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1307">Units</A>.  The co-ordinate can be PostScript points 
(1/72"), millimetres or inches. 
The cursor location is useful for calculating bounding boxes. 
<P>The <B>Select File</B> command is similar to <B>Open</B> but it does not display 
the document. 
This command is useful for opening a document prior to printing it. 
<P>The <B>Save As</B> command saves a copy of the current document. 
This is useful if GSview is being used as a PostScript viewer by 
another application and you wish to save the currently displayed file. 
<P>The <B>Close</B> command closes the currently open document. 
This should be used before the current file is changed by another 
program. 
If you do not do this and GSview detects that the file length or date 
have changed, it will close Ghostscript and rescan the document.

<H1><A NAME="440">Document Information</A></H1>
A brief information area at the top of the window is used by 
GSview to display the document filename, the current page number 
and label (if available) and while the cursor is over the image, the 
location of the cursor (relative to the lower left corner of 
the paper) in co-ordinates specified by <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1307">Units</A>. 
The cursor location is useful for calculating bounding boxes. 
<P>The <B>Info</B> command on the <B>File </B>menu shows a dialog box with the 
following information about the <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments in the current document. 
<P><B>File </B>is the full pathname to the document. 
<P><B>Type</B> is<B> DSC</B>,<B> EPS</B>, <B>No DSC comments</B> or <B>Ignoring DSC Comments</B>. 
<A HREF="#269">EPS</A> is an Encapsulated PostScript File - a single page document 
that contains a subset of the <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments and PostScript commands. 
<B>EPS </B>files are commonly used for inclusion in other documents. 
<B>Ignoring DSC Comments</B> is displayed if <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1530">Ignore DSC</A> 
is selected. 
These may be prefixed by <B>Ctrl-D followed by</B> or <B>PJL followed by</B>. 
Both of these indicate that the document does not comply with 
the DSC because there is some garbage at the beginning of the 
document.  To fix the former, see <A HREF="#1871">Common Problems</A>. 
To fix the latter, do not use a HP LaserJet driver when creating 
PostScript documents for distribution to others. 
<P><B>Title</B> is a text title that can be used when printing banner 
pages and for routing or recognising documents. 
<P><B>Date</B> is the time the document was created. 
<P><A HREF="#830">BoundingBox</A> specifies a box that encloses all the marks painted 
on the page.  The four integer values are the co-ordinates of the 
lower left and upper right corners of the bounding box in default 
user co-ordinates (1/72 inch). 
<P><B>Orientation </B>is the default page orientation and is either 
<B>Portrait </B>or<B> Landscape</B>.  See the <A HREF="#1550">Orientation</A> menu. 
<P><B>Page Order</B> is either <B>Ascending</B>, <B>Descending</B> or <B>Special</B>. 
If <B>Page Order</B> is <B>Descending</B>, GSview automatically reverses 
the pages when displaying or printing so they appear in 
ascending order.  When extracting or printing, GSview can 
be instructed to print pages in descending (reverse) order. 
<B>Special</B> means that pages should not be reordered. 
<P><B>Default Media</B> gives the media name followed by the width and 
height of that media in default user co-ordinates (1/72 inch). 
<P><B>Pages</B> is the total number of pages in the document. 
<P><B>Page</B> gives the page label and page number. 
<P><B>Bitmap </B>is the size of the display bitmap in pixels which may be 
useful if you are copying the displayed image to the clipboard.

<H1><A NAME="496">Printing</A></H1>
The <B>Print</B> command on the <B>File </B>menu allows printing of the document 
using Ghostscript.  There are three methods used by GSview for

<P><A HREF="#541">Windows GDI printer</A> uses Ghostscript to create bitmaps for 
each page, and prints these using the standard Windows printer 
driver.  This is the slowest print method, but should work with 
most printers. 
<P><A HREF="#566">Ghostscript device</A> uses the Ghostscript printer drivers. 
This is faster, but you need Ghostscript to have driver for 
your printer and you need to know what it is called. 
For example, the HP LaserJet 4 uses ljet4. 
See the Ghostscript documentation for more details. 
<P><A HREF="#585">PostScript printer</A> doesn't use Ghostscript for printing 
PostScript files.  Instead the file is sent directly to 
the printer. 
<P>There is a significant amount of interaction between settings

When printing, a range of pages can be selected. 
Within this range, you can select all pages, odd pages or even pages. 
If you select odd pages in the range 10 to 20, the first to 
be printed will be 11. 
<P>The <B>Select Pages</B> button may be disabled if it is not supported by 
the print method. 
<P>The <B>Reverse</B> check box causes the pages to be printed in 
descending order.  This is enabled only if the document 
contains <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments. 
<P>If you wish to print selected pages from a <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> document that

This uses Ghostscript to create a bitmap for each page, and 
these are printed using the standard Windows printer driver. 
This should work on all printers that support raster graphics. 
<P>By default, a monochrome bitmap is used for maximum speed. 
If you want colour, you will need to enable this using 
the <B>Settings </B>button. 
<P>If <B>Fixed media</B> is checked (the default), GSview will use the 
page size on the Media menu and will ignore attempts by PostScript 
or PDF documents to change the page size. 
This is useful for PDF files that contain a mix of portrait and 
landscape pages. 
If <B>Fixed media</B> is unchecked, GSview will set the default page 
size from the Media menu, but allow the page size to be changed. 
<P><B>Options </B>is usually empty, but may contain Ghostscript command 
line options.  Use with care! 
<P>This print method allows selected pages to be printed, even if 
a PostScript document does not contain <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments.  It does 
this by rendering all pages, but only sending the requested ones 
to the printer.  This may be very slow.

<H2><A NAME="566">Ghostscript device</A></H2>
The <B>Select Ghostscript Device</B> dialog box allows selection of 
the Ghostscript printer device and resolution. 
The default list of available devices and resolutions is stored 
in the [Devices] section of gsview32.ini and is taken from the 
standard distribution version of Ghostscript 6.0. 
You can use other devices or resolutions. 
<P>Some Ghostscript options may be added using either the<B> Options</B> 
field or the <A HREF="#623">Properties</A> button. 
<P>The <B>uniprint</B> button selects the uniprint device and displays a list 
of available configuration files (*.upp) for the uniprint device. 
If you select one of these configuration files, the configuration file 
name will be placed in the <B>Options </B>field of the Printer Setup.

If <B>PostScript Printer</B> is selected, the selected pages will be 
sent direct to the printer queue, without using Ghostscript. 
This is similar to <B>File </B>| <A HREF="#617">Print File</A>, except that you can specify 
which pages to print. 
<P>When a PostScript printer is connected via a serial port, it sometimes 
requires a Ctrl+D character to be sent after the PostScript file, 
and depending on how well behaved other programs are, sometimes before. 
This is part of the serial communications protocol used by these 
printers - it is not part of PostScript. 
The <B>Settings </B>dialog allows you can choose to 
send Ctrl+D before and/or after the PostScript file. 
<P>Some PostScript printers understand multiple languages, and 
require a prolog to enable the PostScript mode. 
For example, HP LaserJet printers (with the PostScript option) 
require the following prolog 
<PRE>
 ^[%-12345X@PJL JOB
 @PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = POSTSCRIPT
</PRE>
<P>and the following epilog 
<PRE>
 ^[%-12345X@PJL EOJ
 ^[%12345X
</PRE>
<P>The prolog and epilog files allow you to send a file to the 
printer before and after the PostScript file. 
<P>Another use of the prolog might be to invoke duplex printing 
<PRE>
 &lt;&lt; /Duplex true /Tumble false &gt;&gt; setpagedevice

The <B>Properties</B> button allows some Ghostcript devices to configure 
extra properties and a page offset to be specified. 
<P>A page offset can be specified for each printer. 
The page offset is useful for correcting a mismatch between the page 
origin of a Ghostscript printer device and a particular printer. 
Increasing the X value will translate the image towards the right. 
Increasing the Y value will translate the image downwards. 
<P><B>Properties</B> are typically used to set BitsPerPixel for a colour 
printer or other types of colour or density correction. 
<P><B>Properties</B> are specific to a particular printer.  Changing 
the value of the <B>BitsPerPixel</B> property on one printer does not 
change it for any other printer. 
<P>When you press the <B>OK</B> button in the <B>Properties</B> dialog 
box, the current settings are written to the 
gsview32.ini 
file. 
<P>Some <B>Properties</B> are predefined in GSview, but these may not 
match those available in Ghostscript.  The <B>Edit </B>and <B>New</B>

Not every printer supports the use of optional <A HREF="#623">Properties</A>.  To find 
out which printers support <A HREF="#623">Properties</A> and which <A HREF="#623">Properties</A> are 
recognised by each printer, read the Ghostscript 
file Devices.htm or look at the Ghostscript source code. 
<P>There are two ways to add or edit <A HREF="#623">Properties</A>. 
<P>The first method uses the <B>Edit </B>or <B>New</B> button on the <A HREF="#623">Properties</A> 
dialog box. 
<P>Each property must be either a number or a string.  Number properties 
are equivalent to the Ghostscript <B>-d</B> command line option.  String 
properties are equivalent to the Ghostscript <B>-s</B> command line option. 
Each property consists of a <B>Name</B> and <B>Value</B>.  These are used as 
<B>-dNAME=VALUE</B> or <B>-sNAME=VALUE</B>. 
The <B>Value</B> is chosen from the comma separated list of <B>Values</B> 
entered into the <B>Edit Properties</B> dialog box.  Spaces must not 
be embedded in the <B>Name</B> or <B>Values</B>. 
<P>To delete a property, select it on the <A HREF="#623">Properties</A> dialog box, 
then press<B> Edit</B>, then press the <B>Delete</B> button on the <B>Edit Properties</B> 
dialog box. 
<P>The second method is to manually edit the GSview INI file. 
<P>For each printer, you must add two sections to the 
gsview32.ini 
file. 
The following example shows how to add property information 
for the cdjcolor driver. 
First add a section which gives the current values. 
This section, after the first character is removed, gives the options 
that will appear in the <B>Property</B> list box. 
The first character is <B>s</B> for string or <B>d</B> for number. 
<PRE>
 [cdjcolor]
 dBitsPerPixel=24
 dDepletion=1
 dShingling=2
 dBlackCorrect=4
</PRE>
<P>Next add a section which gives the values to display in the 
<B>Value</B> list box. 
<PRE>
 [cdjcolor values]
 dBitsPerPixel=1,3,8,16,24
 dDepletion=1,2,3
 dShingling=0,1,2
 dBlackCorrect=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
</PRE>
<P>GSview will also add the value <B>[Not defined]</B> to the listbox. 
<P>When GSview prints a file, it will give Ghostscript the contents 
of the [cdjcolor] section of 
gsview32.ini 
as follows: 
<PRE>
 -dBitsPerPixel=24 -dDepletion=1 -dShingling=2 -dBlackCorrect=4

In general, it is not possible to convert a PostScript file to <A HREF="#269">EPS</A>. 
However, many single page PostScript files can be converted to <A HREF="#269">EPS</A> 
by changing the first line of the file to 
<PRE>
 %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
</PRE>
<P>and then adding or fixing up the <B>%%BoundingBox</B> comment. 
<P>EPS files are commonly used for inclusion in other documents and 
for this reason require the bounding box comment: 
<PRE>
  %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury

<P>where llx, lly, urx and ury are integers giving the x and y co-ordinates 
of the lower left and upper right corners of a bounding box which encloses 
all marks made on the page. 
<P><B>When used incorrectly, the PS to EPS command can produce PostScript 
files with incorrect DSC comments.  Such a document will cause problems 
when you try to include it inside another document.</B> 
<P>To convert a PostScript file to <A HREF="#269">EPS</A>, the original file <B>must</B> be 
a <B>single page</B> document.  If the document contains <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments 
and is multi page, extract the desired page with <A HREF="#363">File</A> | <A HREF="#820">Extract</A>. 
If the document does not contain <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> comments, you will need to

<B>Add EPS Preview</B> takes a bitmap from the 
display and uses it to add a preview to an EPS file. 
<B>Add EPS Preview</B> can create a DOS EPS file with a 
Windows Metafile or TIFF preview, or an EPSI file with an Interchange preview. 
To use the <B>Add EPS Preview</B> command the following steps must be followed. 
<P>1. Deselect <B>Options | Ignore DSC</B> 
<P>2. Make sure the document has a correct bounding box. 
<A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1540">Show Bounding Box</A> is useful for checking the 
bounding box. 
A bounding box can be added or changed using <A HREF="#363">File</A> | <A HREF="#830">PS to EPS</A>. 
<P>3. Select <A HREF="#1550">Orientation</A> | <A HREF="#1550">Portrait</A>. 
<P>4. Select <B>Media </B>| <A HREF="#1581">Display Settings</A> and set a suitable resolution 
for the preview.  If the resolution is too high 
it will make the EPS file excessively large. 
<P>5. <A HREF="#363">Open</A> an EPS file that does not contain a preview. 
<P>6.  Select <B>Edit </B>| <B>Add EPS Preview</B>, then the preview format, 
then the new EPS filename.  GSview will write a new file containing 
the original PostScript EPS file and a preview created from the 
display bitmap. 
The available preview formats are <B>Interchange</B>, 
<B>TIFF 4</B>, <B>TIFF 6 uncompressed</B>, <B>TIFF 6 packbits</B> and <B>Windows Metafile</B>. 
If adding an Interchange preview, the document must have an <B>%%EndComments</B> 
line, otherwise GSview may put the preview in the wrong place. 
An interchange preview is always monochrome. 
A TIFF 4 preview is a Baseline Bilevel Image (1 bit/pixel) with 
no compression as described in the TIFF 6.0 memorandum, but avoiding 
tags which are not described in the TIFF 4 specification. 
WordPerfect 5.1 requires a TIFF 4 preview. 
A TIFF 6 preview is a Baseline Bilevel Image, 
or a Baseline Palette-colour Image (4 or 8 bits/pixel) 
or a Baseline RGB Full Colour Image (24 bits/pixel) 
according to the TIFF 6.0 specification. 
TIFF 6 previews are either uncompressed or compressed with packbits. 
A Windows Metafile preview contains an uncompressed bitmap.

<PRE>
 http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/pstoedit.html
</PRE>
<P>To use <B>pstoedit</B> from within GSview, use 
<B>Edit | Convert to vector format</B>. 
Three dialog boxes will be shown. 
<P>The first dialog is for pstoedit settings. 
<P>Select an output <B>Format</B>. 
<P><B>Draw text as polygons</B> should be selected if the PostScript file 
contains text and the output format does not support this, e.g. gnuplot. 
This might produce a large output file. 
<P>When <B>Map to ISO-Latin1</B> is selected, pstoedit maps all character codes 
to the ones defined by the ISO-Latin1 encoding, which is used by 
HTML and MS-Windows.  This is the default. 
If you uncheck this item, the encoding from the input PostScript 
is passed unchanged to the output. 
<P>If the output format does not support curves in the way PostScript 
does, all curves are approximated by lines. The <B>Flatness</B> option 
is used to control this approximation. This parameter is directly 
converted to a PostScript setflat command. Small values produce 
a more accurate approximation, but more line segments. 
<P>Sometimes fonts embedded in a PostScript program do not have a 
fontname. For example, this happens in PostScript files generated 
by dvips. In such a case pstoedit uses a replacement font. 
The default for this is Courier.  Another font can be specified 
using the <B>Default Font</B> option. 
Some alternative font names are Courier, Helvetica and Times-Roman. 
<P>Some of the output formats support extra options.  See the pstoedit 
manual for more details.  For example, the java output format 
uses <B>Driver Options</B> to specify the name of the java class. 
<P>The second dialog (omitted if no page numbering is available) 
specifies the page to be converted, or if supported by the output 
format, a range of pages to be converted. 
<P>The third dialog specifies the output file name. 
<P>Not all <B>pstoedit</B> formats support bitmap graphics. 
If you need bitmap output, see <A HREF="#738">File conversions and tricks</A>.

<H2><A NAME="1038">Text Extract and Find</A></H2>
In general, extracting text from a PostScript document is not a 
trivial operation.  Words may be broken.  Text may be encoded. 
Ligatures may be used (e.g. replacing 'fi' with a single character). 
There may be no relationship between the location of a word in 
the PostScript file and its location on the page. 
Success in extracting text from a PostScript document depends 
greatly on the document itself. 
<P>GSview has two methods of extracting text from a PostScript file. 
<P>The quick method extracts all text from PostScript strings. 
<P>The second method uses pstotext and Ghostscript to more accurately 
extract text from a PostScript document. 
<P>The method used is selected by <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A>. 
See the appropriate topic below:

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="1064">Quick Text Extract and Find</A></H3>
It is common for PostScript documents to contain text in the 
same order as it appears on the page, and for it to be given in 
PostScript strings, surrounded by parentheses.  Complete lines 
may be given in one string, or one word per string.  For this sort 
of document, extracting text can be done with reasonable success. 
<P><B>Edit </B>| <A HREF="#1038">Text Extract</A> will extract text contained in strings from 
specified pages and write it to a text file. 
Line breaks in this text file correspond to lines in the document. 
Spaces in the text file correspond to spaces within strings, or to 
separate strings.  A more effective method of extracting text is to 
use ps2ascii.ps supplied with Ghostscript, or to use the <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A> 
program listed on the Ghostscript <A HREF="#1820">WWW</A> page.  <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A> can be 
used from GSview by using <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A>. 
<P><B>Edit </B>| <A HREF="#1038">Find</A> will search for text and display the first 
page that contains the text.  <A HREF="#1038">Find</A> asks for a search text 
and a range of pages in which to search. 
The preceding comments about extracting text from a PostScript 
document should be noted.  <A HREF="#1038">Find</A> first extracts text from 
the document, then searches it ignoring all spaces in both the 
document and the search text.  Case is ignored when searching. 
Consequently the search text <B>these</B> would match both <B>These</B> 
and <B>The serial</B>.  No information is given about where the word 
is located on a given page because this information is not 
available without a complete PostScript interpreter. 
<A HREF="#1038">Find</A> will not work for non DSC documents or DSC documents with 
special page order. 
<P><B>Edit </B>| <A HREF="#1038">Find Next</A> will continue the search from the next page. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="1096">PStoText Text Extract and Find</A></H3>
This method uses pstotext and Ghostscript to extract text from 
a PostScript document.  Before doing any text extraction or 
searching, the entire PostScript document will be processed by 
Ghostscript and pstotext to produce a text index file. 
This may take a long time.  Once this has finished, text extraction 
and searching should be quick. 
<P>pstotext uses the ISO-Latin1 character set.  See the pstotext 
documentation for more details.

<P><A HREF="#1550">Orientation</A> must be set to match the text direction of the 
document. 
<P><B>Edit </B>| <A HREF="#1038">Text Extract</A> will extract text from specified pages

<P>Words can be copied to the clipboard using<B> Edit</B> | <A HREF="#1144">Copy</A>. 
<P><B>Edit </B>| <A HREF="#1038">Find</A> will search for text and display the first 
page that contains the text.  <A HREF="#1038">Find</A> asks for a search text 
and a range of pages in which to search. 
The search text is first broken up into words.  For each search word, 
a search is made to find a match anywhere within a document word. 
Searching for<B> frog</B> would find<B> frog</B>,<B> frogs</B> and<B> bullfrogs</B>. 
The wildcards '*' (zero or more characters) and '?' (any one character) 
are supported, but it doesn't make sense to use them at the beginning 
or end of a word. 
Wildcards do not extend beyond the word being searched. 
Multiple complete words may be specified, e.g.  <B>GSview is a</B>. 
If the search text is found, the page containing the text is displayed 
and the first word highlighted. 
<A HREF="#1038">Find</A> will not work for non DSC documents or DSC documents with 
special page order. 
<P><B>Edit </B>| <A HREF="#1038">Find Next</A> will continue the search. 
<P>For most PostScript files you should use 
<A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A> | <B>Normal</B>. 
<P><A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A> | <B>Dvips Cork Encoding</B>

<H2><A NAME="1144">Clipboard</A></H2>
The GSview window can be copied to the Clipboard as a bitmap 
by selecting <B>Copy</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu. 
The bitmap will be a Device Independent Bitmap (DIB/BMP format). 
<P>An alternative way to get a bitmap output from Ghostscript is 
to use one of the BMP drivers.  See <A HREF="#496">Print</A>. 
<P><B>Paste To</B> copies a Device Independent Bitmap from the Clipboard 
(if available) to a BMP file. 
<P><B>Convert Bitmap</B> converts between a Device Independent Bitmap and 
a Device Dependent Bitmap. 
If the clipboard contains a Device Independent Bitmap (BMP format), 
this is converted to a Device Dependent Bitmap and added to the clipboard. 
If the clipboard does not contain a colour palette, one is created 
from the Device Independent Bitmap and added to the clipboard. 
This option is present because some applications (notably Windows 
Paintbrush) won't recognise a Device Independent Bitmap in the clipboard. 
<P>If <A HREF="#1038">Text Extract</A> or <A HREF="#1038">Find</A> are used on a document with <A HREF="#1323">PStoText</A> enabled, 
GSview creates an index of the words in the document.  If any words are 
marked with the mouse, <B>Copy</B> will copy these words to the clipboard instead 
of copying a bitmap.  Text cannot be marked until either <A HREF="#1038">Text Extract</A>

Lengths can be measured using the cursor location displayed on 
the status bar, or with the <B>Edit |</B> <B>Measure</B> dialog box. 
<P>This dialog box shows the start location, finish location, 
difference between these locations and the length and angle 
between these locations. 
The start location is set when you click the left mouse button. 
The default start location is the lower left corner of the page. 
The units can be pt, mm, inch, or custom. 
<P>Custom units allows you to display coordinates as they appear 
in a PostScript file. 
Custom units are usually specified by starting with an identity 
matrix and then performing a series of transformations. 
If a PostScript file invokes landscape orientation using 
<PRE>
 90 rotate
 0 -595 translate
</PRE>
<P>then to display the user coordinates you would enter 
the following in the Calculate Transformation dialog:

display bitmap to the bounding box of an EPS file instead of using the 
page size specified on the <A HREF="#1643">Media</A> menu.  This is useful when 
adding a bitmap preview to an EPS file. 
If a PDF file is being displayed, <B>EPS Clip</B> will cause the 
display to be clipped to the PDF crop box. 
<P>If <B>EPS Clip</B> is <B>unchecked</B>, GSview will use the page size 
specified on the <A HREF="#1643">Media</A> menu for EPS files.  This is the default. 
<P><B>EPS Clip</B> does not alter the original document, it only affects 
how much of the document is displayed by GSview. 
It does not affect printing.

<H2><A NAME="1515">EPS Warn</A></H2>
When the <B>EPS Warn</B> option is <B>checked</B>, GSview will write a 
prolog to Ghostscript when each file is opened.  This prolog will 
produce warning messages in the <B>File </B>| <A HREF="#2065">Show Messages</A> 
window if any PostScript operators that should not be used in <A HREF="#269">EPS</A> 
files are used.  An example warning message is:

<P><B>EPS Warn</B> is not infallible.  It is possible to access restricted 
operators without <B>EPS Warn</B> producing a warning.

<H2><A NAME="1530">Ignore DSC</A></H2>
Some documents incorrectly claim to conform to the Adobe Document 
Structuring Conventions.  Attempting to display one of these bogus 
documents will probably leave GSview horribly confused and unable 
to display the document.  If <B>Ignore DSC</B> is <B>checked</B>, GSview 
will treat the document as if it does not contain DSC comments 
and will only display the pages in the original order. 
<P>The default for <B>Ignore DSC</B> is <B>unchecked</B>.

<H2><A NAME="1540">Show Bounding Box</A></H2>
Selecting this option causes a dashed rectangle to drawn over 
the image, showing the location of the bounding box. 
This bounding box is only drawn on the display, and does not 
affect printer output. 
The bounding box will only be shown for <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> documents (non 
conforming documents don't have a bounding box).

<H1><A NAME="1550">Page Orientation</A></H1>
The <B>Portrait</B>, <B>Landscape</B>, <B>Upside-down</B> and <B>Seascape</B> 
(reverse Landscape) commands on the <B>Orientation </B>Menu select 
the page orientation used by the display. 
<B>Landscape</B> implies a clockwise rotation of the paper by 90 degrees. 
<B>Seascape</B> implies an anti-clockwise rotation of the paper by 90 degrees. 
These orientation options only affect the display and do not affect 
the print commands. 
<P>If the <B>Auto</B> command on the orientation menu is checked and 
a <A HREF="#269">DSC</A> page orientation comment is found (%%Orientation or 
%%PageOrientation), the orientation will be selected automatically. 
<P>When the <B>Swap Landscape</B> option is <B>checked</B>, GSview swaps the 
meaning of Landscape and Seascape. 
Most of the Landscape documents that I have encountered require a 90 
clockwise rotation of the paper to view. 
However, there is no standard and some documents need to be rotated 
the other way. 
The <B>Swap Landscape</B> button allows GSview to automatically rotate the 
document the right way in response to the <B>%%Orientation</B> comment in the 
PostScript file.

Some settings for display only can be set with <A HREF="#1643">Media</A> | <B>Display Settings</B>. 
<P>The <B>Resolution</B> field sets the display resolution in dots per inch. 
The default for a VGA display is 96 dots per inch. 
This can also be changed by the resolution changing buttons on 
the button bar. 
<P>For DSC conforming files, pressing the right mouse button will 
<A HREF="#1626">Zoom</A> into the page at what is usually printer resolution. 
Pressing the right mouse button a second time will zoom back out to 
normal display resolution. 
The <B>Zoom Resolution</B> field sets the zoom resolution in dots per inch. 
<P>The <B>Depth</B> field sets the page bitmap depth in bits per pixels 
for the display. 
Default will select the highest depth supported by your display 
driver.  In general, you shouldn't set this higher than your 
actual display depth because doing so will use extra memory 
for the page bitmap but won't improve the display. 
<P>The <B>Text Alpha</B> field sets anti-aliasing for fonts.  The default 
(use anti-aliasing) is 4 bits.  To disable anti-aliasing of fonts, 
use 1 bit. 
<P><B>IMPORTANT</B>: If you use <B>Text Alpha</B>, GSview will disable 
<B>Platform Fonts</B> by doing the equivalent of adding 
<PRE>
  -dNOPLATFONTS
</PRE>
<P>to the <B>Options </B>| <B>Configure Ghostscript</B> Ghostscript Options field. 
<P>The <B>Graphics Alpha</B> field sets anti-aliasing for graphics and 
also for text that is too large to fit in the font cache. 
<P>Using anti-aliasing slows down drawing. 
Text and Graphics Alpha can only be used if your display depth is 
set to 8bits/pixel or higher.

<P>A user defined size can be specified in PostScript points (1/72 inch) 
with the <B>User Defined</B> command.  A size of 480x360 points at 96 dpi

<P>If <B>Rotate Media</B> is checked, the width and height of the page 
are exchanged.  The image drawn on the page is not rotated. 
This affects both display and printing. 
Selecting <B>A4</B> and <B>Rotate Media</B> is equivalent to selecting

<H1><A NAME="1871">Common Problems</A></H1>
<B>Problem:</B> Can't load Ghostscript DLL ... 
<P>GSview requires the Ghostscript DLL 
(gsdll2.dll for OS/2, gsdll32.dll for Win32). 
This error message usually occurs if you don't have Ghostscript, 
or if GSview can't find Ghostscript. 
<P>From the GSview menu select <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <B>Configure Ghostscript</B> 
and enter the correct <A HREF="#1226">Ghostscript DLL</A> path. For example 
<PRE>
 c:\Aladdin\gsN.NN\bin\gsdll32.dll
</PRE>
<P>This message also occurs if Ghostscript cannot find its 
initialisation files (e.g. gs_init.ps).  Set the 
<A HREF="#1226">Ghostscript Include Path</A> correctly. 
<P>If using Win32s, make sure you don't already have a copy of 
the Ghostscript DLL loaded by another copy of GSview. 
Only one copy of Ghostscript DLL can be loaded by Win32s at a time. 
<P>If you can't get GSview to run Ghostscript DLL correctly, make sure 
you can configure and run Ghostscript on its own. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> Ghostscript Messages window says 
<B>Can't find initialization file gs_init.ps</B>. 
<P>Set the <A HREF="#1226">Ghostscript Include Path</A> to point to the directory containing 
the correct gs_init.ps. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> Ghostscript Messages window says 
<B>gs: Interpreter revision (XXX) does not match gs_init.ps revision (YYY)</B>. 
<P>Set the <A HREF="#1226">Ghostscript Include Path</A> to point to the directory containing 
the correct gs_init.ps. 
Don't try to display a PostScript file in the directory of an old 
version of Ghostscript (which will cause the old gs_init.ps to be 
loaded irrespective of the <A HREF="#1226">Ghostscript Include Path</A>). 
<P><B>Problem:</B> Ghostscript Messages window says 
<B>Wrong version of DLL found.  Found version XXX  Need version YYY</B>. 
<P>GSview found the wrong Ghostscript DLL.  Install the required 
version of the Ghostscript DLL.  Make sure you have only one copy 
of the Ghostscript DLL on your system. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> GSview says that a multipage PostScript file produced 
by MS-Windows contains 0 pages and will only show the first page. 
<P>This is because the document does not have correct DSC comments. 
From the Control Panel, select <B>Printers</B>, <B>Options...</B>, then in the 
<B>Print to</B> group box click on the <B>Printer</B> radio button.  You cannot 
use the <B>Print To</B> <B>Encapsulated PostScript File</B> for printing 
multipage files.  The correct method is to connect the printer 
to <B>FILE:</B>. 
In addition, 
from the Control Panel select <B>Printers</B>, <B>Options...</B>, <B>Advanced</B> and 
then check <B>Conform to Adobe Document Structuring Convention</B>. 
<P>The DSC comment <B>%%Pages: 0</B> means that the document does not produce 
any pages.  That is, the PostScript <B>showpage</B> operator is not used. 
If you find a PostScript document that has multiple pages and contains 
the <B>%%Pages: 0</B> comment, change the first line from <B>%!PS-Adobe-</B> to <B>%!</B>. 
GSview will then ignore the DSC comments and allow you to view all 
pages, but only in the original order.  Complain to the author of the 
program that produced that PostScript file. 
<P>Some PostScript printer drivers include code that is specific to 
a particular printer.  The PostScript output from these drivers may 
be unportable and may not display in GSview.  If you are having this 
problem, try using a reasonably generic PostScript driver such as 
<B>Apple LaserWriter II NT</B> for PostScript level 2 printers, or 
<B>Apple LaserWriter Plus</B> for PostScript level 1 printers. 
<P>For Windows 95, open the printer properties then select the 
PostScript tab, then select PostScript Output Format = 
<B>PostScript (optimize for portability - ADSC)</B>. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> GSview says "Page ordering is Special..." 
<P>Your document used the DSC comment <B>%%PageOrder: Special</B> which means 
that pages can not be reliably reordered.  This may prevent GSview 
from displaying pages in any order other than the original order. 
If you continue and reorder the pages, PostScript errors may occur. 
The only way to fix this is to regenerate the PostScript without 
special page ordering. 
<P>By default, Windows 95 creates PostScript files which use special 
page ordering.  To disable this, open the printer properties then 
select the PostScript tab, then select PostScript Output Format = 
<B>PostScript (optimize for portability - ADSC)</B>. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> PostScript files produced by MS-Windows start with a Control-D. 
<P>For Windows 3.1: 
<P>Since this occurs even when the PostScript printer 
<B>Conform to Document Structuring Convention</B> 
checkbox is checked, this must be considered a 
bug in the MS-Windows PostScript printer driver. 
The bug fix is documented in the MS-Windows PRINTERS.WRI file. 
Edit the win.ini file and search for the PostScript printer section. 
There may be more than one.  In each of these sections add 
<B>CTRLD=0</B> as shown below. 
<P><PRE>
 [Apple LaserWriter II NT,FILE]
 CTRLD=0
</PRE>
<P>For Windows 95: 
<P>The PostScript printer driver setup has an option 
(Properties, PostScript, Advanced) for suppressing 
a ^D at the start of a document. 
Fortunately the default is do not send ^D before job. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> PostScript files produced by Word for Windows 6.0 
cause a "Missing %%Pages comment" message box. 
<P>Congratulations.  You have just found a mistake in the DSC comments 
when Word included an EPS file.  Word should have surrounded the 
included EPS file with the lines 
<PRE>
 %%BeginDocument: filename.eps
 %%EndDocument
</PRE>
<P>Because Word didn't do this, GSview can't tell how many pages 
are in the document and where they are located. 
<P>Please complain to Microsoft.  There is a problem in the EPSIMP.FLT 
filter version 2.01 which Microsoft needs to fix. 
<P>In the interim, you have two solutions: 
<P>1. Select <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> | <A HREF="#1530">Ignore DSC</A> 
<P>2. Edit the PostScript file to correct the DSC comments. 
Search the PostScript file for all lines containing

 Resetting page size and resolution
</PRE>
<P>Either the problem described in the error message has occurred, 
in which case you should reduce the page size, resolution, 
depth or a combination of all three. 
Alternatively, you may have used <B>-dFIXEDMEDIA</B> in the Ghostscript 
environment variable GS_OPTIONS.  When using GSview, it is safest 
not to use GS_OPTIONS at all and to use <A HREF="#1210">Options</A> |

<B>RedMon</B> is a Windows 95 and NT port monitor, which allows you 
to redirect a printer port to a program. 
RedMon can be used with Ghostscript and a non-PostScript printer 
to emulate a PostScript printer.  This emulated PostScript printer 
can be shared on a computer network and appears as a PostScript 
printer to network clients.   More details at:

GSview uses Ghostscript to display or print PostScript files. 
<B>Show Messages</B> displays the console output from Ghostscript, 
and is most useful when a PostScript error occurs. 
You may need to scroll back to see the start of the error message. 
<P>The text in the <B>Show Messages</B> window can be copied to the clipboard. 
If no text is selected, the entire text will be copied to the clipboard. 
If some text is highlighted, only that text will be copied to the 
clipboard. 
<P>Explanations of some of the error message that may appear in the 
<B>Show Messages</B> are given in the <A HREF="#1871">Common Problems</A> topic.

If you attempt to load a file that has been compressed by bzip2, 
GSview will attempt to load the bzip2 DLL, then uncompress it 
to a temporary file. 
<P>If you get an error message <B>Failed to load bzip2 DLL...</B> then 
you probably don't have the bzip2 DLL available. 
Obtain it from the same place you obtained GSview or from

</PRE>
<P>Place the bzip2 DLL in the same directory as the GSview EXE. 
libbz2.dll is for Win32.  At this stage there is no bzip2 DLL 
for Win16 or OS/2.

GSview uses the Aladdin Ghostscript DLL to render PostScript files. 
<P>Under Win32s, the GS DLL can be used by only one application at a 
time.  Under Windows 95, Windows NT and OS/2, the GS DLL can be used 
by many applications at a time (provided you have enough memory). 
When using Win32s, GSview must unload the GS DLL while it is being 
used by gvwgs.exe for printing. 
<P>gsv16spl.exe is a 16 bit Windows application used by GSview to spool 
files from GSview Win32s.  gsv16spl can not be used on its own - it 
must be started by GSview.  It is not used by Windows 95 or NT. 
<P>gvwgs32.exe (Windows) and gvpgs.exe (OS/2) are GS DLL loaders for 
printing.  It would be possible to use them from the command line, 
but since they delete the files listed on the command line 
it would be safer to use gswin32.exe (Win32), gswin32c.exe 
(Win32 console) or gsos2.exe (OS/2).
