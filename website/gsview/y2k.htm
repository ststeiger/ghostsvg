GSview is provided with absolutely no warranty of any kind.  
<P>
The current version of GSview (2.7) uses dates in four places:
<OL>
<LI>
When GSview opens a file, it saves the file length and 
modification time, returned by the C library function <TT>fstat()</TT>.
Whenever GSview reopens this file, it performs an equality 
test on this information to determine if the file has changed.
Times are stored in Unix format.
<LI>
When writing EPS files, GSview inserts the <TT>%%CreationDate:</TT>
comment using the standard C run time library functions 
<TT>time()</TT> and <TT>ctime()</TT>.
<LI>
When writing TIFF files, GSview inserts the date using
the standard C run time library <TT>time()</TT> and 
<TT>localtime()</TT>, 
The date is written as a text string in the form
<TT>YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS</TT>, as per the TIFF specification.
<LI>
In beta versions only, GSview compares the system time with
an expiry date, and refuses to operated after this date.
This does not apply to release versions of GSview.
</OL>

The Unix time format stores dates as seconds since 
1 January 1970 in variables of type <TT>time_t</TT>.
On most systems today, including those used by Ghostgum Software Pty Ltd, 
this is a 32-bit signed number which will roll over during the year 2038.
It is hoped that by the time 2038 arrives, time_t will be
64-bits or larger.
<P>
The use of dates by GSview depends on the C run time library,
over which we have no control.
<P>
Again, this statement is only for your information - 
it is not a warranty.
