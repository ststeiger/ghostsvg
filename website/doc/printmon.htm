<HR>
PRINTMON is a printer device monitor, that allows, for example,
GhostScript to be used as the back end of a PostScript PM printer
queue. However, other applications are possible, such as sending the
output of a printer queue over some kind of network or dialup
connection, using an appropriately written forwarding program.
<P>
If printmon is used together with GhostScript, GS can process the jobs
of the monitored PostScript printing queue and send the output to your
real printer, such as a LaserJet or any other printer supported by GS
that is not capable of interpreting PostScript directly. 
<P>
This allows you to print transparently using PostScript from any
application in your system without having to print to files and to
call GhostScript manually. 
<P>
Ideally, such a setup is installed on a LAN server which can then
export the PostScript queue processed by GhostScript to any LAN
clients. Then the clients don't have to worry (or even know) that
there is no *real* PostScript printer on the net but a "dumb" one
driven by GhostScript.
<P>
A sample use of printmon with GhostScript is demonstrated in
gsmon.cmd:
<PRE>
    @echo off
    rem how to use the printer device monitor with GS
    setlocal
    set gs_lib=c:/ghost/lib;c:/psfonts
    set gs_load=10
    printmon lpt2 "gs -sDEVICE=ljet3 -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -sOUTPUTFILE=lpt1 -q -"
    endlocal
</PRE>
<P>
As you can see, the source code (printmon.c) is remarkably simple.
However, it uses the 16-bit device monitor API (DosMon), that is not
available in a 32-bit variant (similar to Kbd, Vio and Mou). But the
API can be accessed with gcc using the interface definition in mon16.*
for emx 0.8h and above. Printmon can also be compiled with MS C 6.00,
in this case the DosMon API is available directly.
<P>
The program requires the EMX runtime DLL's, get the latest emxrt.zip
which contains it. 
<P>
This program is freeware. The author is not responsible in any way for
any problem caused by it, even if the program is used correctly.
