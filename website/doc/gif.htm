<h1>GIF is not supported by Ghostscript</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Because of actions by CompuServe and Unisys related to a patent that claims
  to cover the data compression method used in GIF, anyone who distributes any
  new GIF software (even readers, but definitely software that creates GIF
  files) after January 1, 1995 may be subject to legal action if they do not
  get a license from Unisys, and/or unpredictable payment requirements if they
  do get such a license.  I cannot run the risk of having this happen.  If you
  wish to run this risk, you may extract the GIF software (gdevgif.c and a
  small part of devs.mak) from Aladdin Ghostscript 3.12, which was originally
  released in 1994.
<p>
You should also consider alternatives to GIF, such as JPEG 
or PNG which are supported by Ghostscript.
