~Subject: 1 General Questions


~Subject: 1.1 What is Ghostscript

   Ghostscript is a software package that interprets Adobe's 
   PostScript (TM) language, including a few additional features. 
   For further information read the file language.doc from the current 
   Ghostscript distribution. 

   For informations on PostScript read the comp.lang.postscript FAQ. 
   It is available by anonymous ftp to
     ftp://wilma.cs.brown.edu/pub/comp.lang.postscript/FAQ.txt
   in ASCII, and there are also LaTeX, DVI, and PostScript formats.

~Subject: 1.2 What is the current version of Ghostscript?

   There are two versions of Ghostscript currently available. 

   The current Aladdin Ghostscript version is 5.10. 

   The current GNU Ghostscript version is 3.33.

~Subject: 1.3 What is the difference between Aladdin Ghostscript 
                 and GNU Ghostscript.

   Aladdin Ghostscript is distributed with a license called the Aladdin 
   Ghostscript Free Public License that allows free use, copying, and
   distribution by end users, but does not allow commercial distribution. 

   GNU Ghostscript is distributed with the GNU General Public License, 
   which allows free use, and free copying and redistribution under
   certain conditions (including, in some cases, commercial distribution). 

~Subject: 1.4 Where can I get Ghostscript?

   You can get GNU Ghostscript from ftp.cs.wisc.edu (128.105.2.15) 
   from the directory ghost/gnu or from prep.ai.mit.edu. Please 
   try first one of the usual mirrors (for example: germany.eu.net). 
   The URL is
     ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/gnu

   You can get Aladdin Ghostscript from 
     ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin
   or from any CTAN mirror in 
     /support/ghostscript/aladdin

~|Subject 1.5 Where can I find a list of post-release problems?

   For a list of problems, fixes and workarounds for a given 
   release, see
     http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/relnotes/

~Subject: 1.6 Where can I get patches for Ghostscript ?

   If there are patches, you can get them from ftp.cs.wisc.edu 
   (128.105.2.15) from the directory ghost or from
   prep.ai.mit.edu.

~Subject: 1.7 Which USENET newsgroups are relevant to Ghostscript?

   Discussion about Aladdin Ghostscript and GSview can be found in the
   USENET newsgroup
     comp.lang.postscript

   Discussion about GNU Ghostscript and Ghostview can be found in the
   USENET newsgroup
     gnu.ghostscript.bug

~Subject: 1.8 Why do my fonts look ugly at larger point sizes?

   Older versions of Ghostscript came with fonts that look ugly 
   (jagged text), when you use them at larger sizes. 
   Fonts downloaded as part of the postscript file look fine. 
   This is because the fonts coming with old versions of 
   Ghostscript are overworked bitmapped fonts. 
   The solution is to get high quality fonts, for example the 
   Adobe Type Manager fonts. Also third-party Type 1 fonts from 
   Bitstream, URW, Soft Horizons and many other suppliers work. 
   Please read your corresponding font licences. 


   Aladdin Ghostscript 4.0 and later come with a set of high 
   quality fonts, made available by URW.

~Subject: 1.9 How do I display a particular page?

   You need a previewer based on Ghostscript. These are described 
   in the Ghostscript README. Some previewers are: 

   Ghostview 1.5 (X11): 
     ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/gnu/ghostview/ghostview-1.5.tar.gz
   GSview (Windows and OS/2) 2.5. 
     ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/rjl/gsview25.zip

~Subject: 1.10 ZapfDingbats gives "/invalidfont in -dicttype-" with gs 2.6.1.

   The file gs_dbt_e.ps was not copied to the library directory, 
   due to an error in the ghostscript installation procedure. 
   Copy this file manually to the library directory. 
   (I.e. where the rest of the *.ps files for ghostscript are.) 

~Subject: 1.11 Without FTP access to the Internet. How can I get Ghostscript?

   GNU Ghostscript is included in the GNU distribution from the Free Software 
   Foundation; e-mail to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu for information on ordering 
   their tapes, floppies, or CD-ROMs.  Ghostscript is generally included in 
   less-commercial Unix systems such as Linux and BSDI, and also appears on 
   some freeware CD-ROMs.  Some commercial services like Compuserve and 
   Genie, and many privately run bulletin board systems (BBSs), make 
   Ghostscript available for downloading, but their copies are likely to be 
   incomplete or obsolete.

   If you do not have convenient access to the Internet, you can order 
   Aladdin Ghostscript on a CD-R disc, along with some useful related 
   programs and documentation: for more information, see
	http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/cd.html
   or send e-mail to Russell Lang (see the e-mail address above).
   Please note that this is not "commercial licensing"; you are still
   getting freely redistributable software, with no support and no warranty.

~Subject: 1.12 Why won't Aladdin Ghostscript read piped PDF files?

   Portable Document Format is a file format which contains forward
   and backward links.  It is not a stream format like PostScript.
   You cannot pipe PDF files to the stdin of Ghostscript.  Instead
   you must either give the PDF filename on the command line, or
   use it as the argument of the Ghostscript run command.

~|Subject: 1.13 How do you display PDF files with Ghostview?

   Since Ghostview pipes PostScript files to Ghostscript, you
   cannot start Ghostview as
          ghostview file.pdf
   Instead there are several options:

   1. Tanmoy Bhattacharya has written some patches for Ghostview 1.5
   that allow it to read and display PDF files.  These are available 
   from:
       ftp://gita.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/gv1.5gs3.33hack.tar.gz

   2. Start Ghostview as follows:
          ghostview -arguments file.pdf quit.ps
   This will allow you to display a PDF file, but you won't be able
   to jump to particular pages.  Use Tanmoy's code if you want that
   facility.

   3. With ghostscript 3.53 or later, create an `index file' by saying
          pdf2dsc file.pdf file.pdx
          ghostview file.pdx
   This lets you display particular pages of a pdf file even without a
   patched version of ghostview. The index file isn't a postscript
   version of the pdf file, just a series of commands to ghostscript
   saying `display page 1 of file.pdf', `display page 2', and so on.

   4. Use GV, a modified version of Ghostview available from
      http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/
~Subject: 2 Platform specific Questions

~Subject: 2.1 HPUX

   On HP 9000/700 (and other), the HP C-compiler has a bug that 
   is fatal for gs. You must have the latest C compiler patch 
   to compile gs. The patch is PHSS_3015, which results in the
   following 'what /bin/cc': 
   /bin/cc: 
   HP92453-01 A.09.34 HP C Compiler 

   Further you need the patches PHSS_2199 and PHSS_3537. 

~Subject: 2.2 DEC ALPHA AX

   When you run Ghostscript on AXP (Alpha) machines, text does not 
   appear properly (or does not appear at all) on the screen. 
   Versions of Ghostscript through 2.6.1 have a number of bugs that 
   prevent them from working properly on 64-bit architectures. Versions 
   starting with 3.0 will work properly on 64-bit machines. 


~Subject: 2.3 UnixWare 1.0

   There is a chance that you can not link gs, because your enviroment 
   is not big enough. You can change the enviroment size with a kernel 
   variable: ARG_MAX. Change this with /etc/conf/idtune and rebuild 
   the kernel. For further reference read the manpages. 

~Subject: 2.4 SCO Unix (ODT3.0)

   There is a chance that you can not link gs, because your enviroment 
   is not big enough. You can change the enviroment size with a
   parameter in the file /usr/include/sys/param.h and a kernel rebuilt. 

   Tom Kelly about building gs 2.6.1 for SCO ODT 3.0: 

   I have patches for the makefile that allow it to be built without 
   modifying the kernel.  The modified makefile can be obtained from 
     ftp://ftp.sco.com/Skunk/src/Tools/gs261/unix-ansi.mak 

~Subject: 2.5 X Windows

~Subject: 2.5.1 Why do I get a "Malformed color property" message under X Windows?

   This is a Ghostscript bug that was fixed by a patch released 
   separately from Ghostscript 2.6.1.  See section 1.5 for information 
   about patches.   This bug is fixed in GNU Ghostscript 2.6.2.

~Subject: 2.5.2 Why do I get "Can't allocate backing pixmap" messages?

   Some servers do not implement backing pixmaps properly, or do not
   have enough memory for them.  If you get strange behavior or "out
   of memory" messages, try setting the useBackingPixmap resource
   to false.

~Subject: 2.5.3 Why do I get white or black rectangles where characters 
                should appear?

   Some servers do not implement bitmap/pixmap displaying properly. 
   This may show up as white or black rectangles where characters 
   should appear, or characters may appear in "inverse video" (e.g.,
   white on a black rectangle).  If this happens, try setting 
   the useXPutImage resource to false.

~Subject: 2.6 DOS

~Subject: 2.6.1 On my DOS system using GS.EXE (Borland compiler), 
                why do I get a 'limitcheck in setdevice' 
                or 'VMerror in setdevice' error message?

   On DOS systems using the Borland compiler, if Ghostscript gives you 
   a 'limitcheck in setdevice' error, it may mean Ghostscript's standard 
   buffer size wasn't large enough.  Likewise, if Ghostscript gives you a 
   'VMerror in setdevice' error, it means the buffer size was too large. You 
   can use the -dBufferSpace= switch to set the buffer size to a different 
   value, e.g., 
     -dBufferSpace=50000 
   The default value is 25000; the smallest value Ghostscript accepts is 
   10000; the largest valid value is 65000. 

~Subject: 2.6.2 Watcom C 9.0x, I can't compile gs, wmake has 
                a memory size problem. Is the makefile too big?

   wmake.exe is a normal DOS application with a 64K limit. You 
   should ask Watcom for an enhanced mode version, or update 
   to a newer Watcom C version, this problem is fixed there. 

~Subject: 2.7 MS Windows

~Subject: 2.7.1 MS Windows GSview cannot execute GSWIN.

   The most common problem is that you have not set up your ghostscript 
   command line correctly in the "Options | Ghostscript Command" menu item. 
   The GSWIN command should look like: 
     D:\GS\GSWIN -ID:\GS;D:\GS\GSFONTS
   assuming you installed GSWIN in D:\GS, and your fonts in D:\GS\GSFONTS. 

~Subject: 2.7.2 MS Windows GSWIN fails with exit code -13 or -15.

   This is due to a bug in GSview 1.3 and earlier, and Aladdin 
   Ghostscript 3.51 and earlier.  This error is caused when a display 
   driver returns a depth other than 1, 4, 8, 16 or 24.
   As a work around, in GSview set "Media | Depth" to something
   other than default, preferably the value that best matches
   your display driver.  For Ghostscript, use the -dBitsPerPixel=XX
   switch, using one of the values listed above.

~Subject: 3 Device specific Questions

~Subject: 3.1 Why isn't GIF supported in Ghostscript?

  L. Peter Deutsch of Aladdin Enterprises writes:

  Because of actions by CompuServe and Unisys related to a patent that claims
  to cover the data compression method used in GIF, anyone who distributes any
  new GIF software (even readers, but definitely software that creates GIF
  files) after January 1, 1995 may be subject to legal action if they do not
  get a license from Unisys, and/or unpredictable payment requirements if they
  do get such a license.  I cannot run the risk of having this happen.  If you
  wish to run this risk, you may extract the GIF software (gdevgif.c and a
  small part of devs.mak) from Aladdin Ghostscript 3.12, which was originally
  released in 1994.

~Subject: 3.2 The spacing of characters / words / margins on the display
              is wrong, what can I do?

   This is almost always caused by differences between the character 
   widths that were used to format the document and the character widths 
   of the fonts installed in your system.  (This only affects the 
   display, and only with window systems, not with DOS.)  If this 
   happens, invoke Ghostscript with the -dNOPLATFONTS switch, or
   (on X Windows) set 
     Ghostscript*useExternalFonts: false
   in your X resource file. 

   For more information about fonts on the display, please read the 
   first sections of fonts.doc. 

~Subject: 3.3 On my H-P LaserJet, why do I only get a partial page of output, 
              or a single page gets split across two sheets?

   Printing on a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet at full resolution (300 DPI) 
   requires a printer with at least 1.5 Mb of memory.  150 DPI printing 
   requires only .5 Mb.  You can select 150 DPI printing with the command 
   line switch 
     -r150 
   (This is not necessary on DeskJet printers.)
