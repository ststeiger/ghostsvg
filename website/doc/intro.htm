<HR>
Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language.
A PostScript interpreter usually takes as input a set of graphics
commands.  The output is usually a page bitmap which is then sent 
to an output device such as a printer or display.
PostScript is embedded in many printers.
<P>
Ghostscript has several main uses:
<OL>
<LI> Display a PostScript file (avoid killing trees).
<LI> Display a PostScript file to decide if you really need to 
     print it (reduce the number of trees killed).
<LI> Print a PostScript file to a non-PostScript printer
     (kill more trees).
</OL>
<P>
An example of a very simple PostScript file is:
<PRE>
  %!
  /Helvetica findfont 72 scalefont setfont
  72 72 moveto
  (Hello, world!) show
  showpage
</PRE>
The first line is a PostScript comment.  It is ignored by the 
PostScript interpreter, but enables other programs to recognise
that the file contains PostScript commands.
The second line says to find the Helvetica font, scale it to 72 points
high (1 inch) and then set it as the current font.
The third line moves the current point to 1 inch in from the left
and bottom edges of the page.
The fourth line draws the text into the page bitmap at the current point.
The final line causes the page bitmap to be output to paper or the
display.
<P>
The information below assumes the use of Windows 95 or NT, 
but Windows 3.1, OS/2 and Unix are similar.

<H1>Displaying a PostScript file</H1>
Let's assume that you wish to display the above PostScript example
and it is in a file named example.ps in the current directory.
If Ghostscript is in the directory <TT>c:\gs3.53</TT> and its fonts are
in <TT>c:\gs3.53\fonts</TT>, then you would start Ghostscript using:
<PRE>
    c:\gs3.53\gswin32.exe -Ic:\gs3.53;c:\gs3.53\fonts
</PRE>
The <TT>-I</TT> option tells Ghostscript to look for its 
configuration files and fonts in the two directories listed.
After Ghostscript starts it will display
<PRE>
  Aladdin Ghostscript 3.53 (1996-1-10)
  Copyright (c) 1995 Aladdin Enterprises, Menlo Park, CA.  All rights reserved.
  This software comes with NO WARRANTY: see the file PUBLIC for details.
  GS&gt;
</PRE>
Ghostscript is now waiting for you to tell it what to do.  Typing
<TT>(example.ps) run</TT> will produce
<PRE>
  GS&gt;(example.ps) run
  Loading NimbusSansL-Regular font from C:\gs3.53\fonts\n019003l.gsf... 
   1758852 452265 1300076 12334 0 done.
  &gt;&gt;showpage, press &lt;return&gt; to continue&lt;&lt;
</PRE>
An image window will appear with the text "Hello, world!" near the
bottom.  You will need to scroll down to see it.
When you have finished viewing the image window, switch to the
text window and press the <TT>&lt;return&gt;</TT> key.  You will be returned to
the <TT>GS&gt;</TT> prompt.  Type <TT>quit</TT> to close Ghostscript.
<PRE>
  GS&gt;quit
</PRE>
If the file is not in the current directory, then you will 
need to give a full path.  You must use forward slashes to
separate directory names - do not use MS-DOS back slashes.
For example, <TT>(c:/gs3.53/example.ps) run</TT>.
<P>
So now you know how to display a PostScript file.  Some example
PostScript files that come with Ghostscript are <TT>colorcir.ps</TT>,
<TT>chess.ps</TT> and <TT>tiger.ps</TT>.  These should be in
the <TT>c:\gs3.53</TT> directory.

<H1>Printing a PostScript file</H1>
In the above display example, we did not specify which output
device Ghostscript should use.  Ghostscript used the default
device, which happened to be the display.  To print a PostScript
file, we need to tell Ghostscript the name of the printer device.
For an HP DeskJet 500 or an HP DeskJet Portable printer, 
this is <TT>djet500</TT>.  
We would instead start Ghostscript with:
<PRE>
  c:\gs3.53\gswin32.exe -Ic:\gs3.53;c:\gs3.53\fonts -sDEVICE=djet500
</PRE>
The output will be sent to the default printer queue. 
For the Windows and OS/2 version, this does not happen until
Ghostscript exits.
Ghostscript will come up with the <TT>GS&gt;</TT> prompt again,
we give it a file name, and after processing each page it will 
pause.  This is probably undesirable.  A better way to start
Ghostscript is:
<PRE>
  c:\gs3.53\gswin32.exe -Ic:\gs3.53;c:\gs3.53\fonts -sDEVICE=djet500 
      -dNOPAUSE example.ps -c quit
</PRE>
This tells Ghostscript not to pause after each showpage, to interpret
the file <TT>example.ps</TT> and afterwards to exit.
This is much more useful.
<P>
To get a list of available printer devices, start Ghostscript
for displaying, then type:
<PRE>
  GS&gt;devicenames ==
</PRE>
What if the printer isn't on the default queue?
The destination for the printed output can be specified on
the command line.
To output to the file <TT>c:\out.prn</TT>, 
add <TT>-sOutputFile="c:/out.prn"</TT> somewhere before the name of 
the PostScript file.
To output to a Windows 95 queue named <TT>HP DeskJet Portable Printer</TT>,
use <TT>-sOutputFile="\\spool\HP DeskJet Portable Printer"</TT>.
Get the spelling exact or it won't work.  For Windows 3.1 or Win32s,
to output to port <TT>LPT2:</TT>, 
use <TT>-sOutputFile="LPT2:"</TT>

<H1>More details</H1>
If you want more details about the Ghostscript command line options, 
see the file 
<A HREF="AFPL/cvs/Use.htm">Use.htm</A>
distributed with Ghostscript.

<H1>A better way</H1>
If you are like me, you get sick of typing the long commands above.
I wrote a program called 
<A HREF="../gsview/index.htm">GSview</A>
to avoid having to remember or type all these commands.
To display a file you select <B>File | Open</B> from the menu.  
To print a file you select <B>File | Print</B> from the menu, then 
select your printer from the presented list.
Other advantages are the ability to display page 20 without
having to display pages 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 20.
For printing you can tell it to print an arbitrary selection
of pages.  GSview is available for Windows, OS/2 and X11/Linux.
<P>
A similar program called 
<A HREF="../gv/index.htm">GV</A> exists for X11 on Unix or VMS.
