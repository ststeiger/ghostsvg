<H1>GNU Ghostscript</H1>
<HR>
Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:
  <UL>
  <LI> An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language and the Adobe
       Portable Document Format (PDF -- sometimes confused with Acrobat, 
       Adobe's PDF browser/editor product), and
  <LI> A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement
       the graphics and filtering (data compression / decompression 
       / conversion) capabilities that appear as primitive operations 
       in the PostScript language and in PDF.
