<h1><a name="Version7.05"></a>Version 7.05 (2002-04-22)</h1>

<p>This is the first release of the stable 7.0x series under the GNU
GPL, following one year after the release of 7.00. The license change in
the major reason for this release, and we hope the community of
Free Software users will enjoy the much improved features of the new
stable branch.

<p>Another major change over the 7.04 release is a improved asian
language support from the gs-cjk team. This is a new version of the
work released with 6.53.

<p>And of course there are the usual bug fixes and minor improvements.

<p>At the time of release, the following bugs were open against all
ghostscript versions:

<h2><a name="7.05-Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- corrects a typo in the new Id: line (doc/index.html [1.2.4.2]:
2002/04/10 09:45:40 giles)
	- the url for the guide to international paper sizes has changed.
Thanks to Nelson Beebe for finding th e update. (doc/Use.htm [1.33.2.7]:

Documents the work-around of using '#' instead of '=' to separate command
line options from their arguments. The was previously listed only as a quirk
of the Wacom build on MS-DOS, but is also needed on win32 because the
command shell treats '=' as whitespace in passing arguments to batch files
(like ps2pdf.bat). Closes SourceForge bug #483066. Also documents that
MS-DOS is no longer a supported operating system. (doc/Use.htm [1.33.2.4]:
2002/02/01 19:43:02 giles)

Adds support for compilation against a standard shared libjpeg. It is
believed that non-baseline compliant DCTEncoded data, permitted by early
versions of postscript, is now extremely rare and the prohibition against
SHARE_JPEG=1 may reasonably be removed. The autoconf build will prefer a
local copy of the jpeg source, in which case the D_MAX_BLOCKS_IN_MCU patch
will still be applied. If no such local copy is found, it will try to find a
shared library on the system. For all unix builds, if $(JSRCDIR)/jmemsys.h
cannot be found, we define DONT_HAVE_JMEMSYS_H and include our own versions
of the libjpeg memory manager prototypes. The default allocator in the
shared library is overridden by the ghostscript one at link-time. While this
may be implementation-dependent, it appears to function as desired on at
least GNU/Linux and Solaris. Also changes the autoconf build to prefer local
zlib and libpng source, and cleans up some variable names. Patch by Raph
Levien from 7.20. (dvx-gcc.mak [1.12.2.4], macosx.mak [1.3.2.4],

xdev-&gt;color_info.depth. These are the same in all cases except a visual
depth of 15, in which the latter is 16. (gdevx.c [1.8.2.2]: 2002/02/20

Adds support for compilation against a standard shared libjpeg. It is
believed that non-baseline compliant DCTEncoded data, permitted by early
versions of postscript, is now extremely rare and the prohibition against
SHARE_JPEG=1 may reasonably be removed. The autoconf build will prefer a
local copy of the jpeg source, in which case the D_MAX_BLOCKS_IN_MCU patch
will still be applied. If no such local copy is found, it will try to find a
shared library on the system. For all unix builds, if $(JSRCDIR)/jmemsys.h
cannot be found, we define DONT_HAVE_JMEMSYS_H and include our own versions
of the libjpeg memory manager prototypes. The default allocator in the
shared library is overridden by the ghostscript one at link-time. While this
may be implementation-dependent, it appears to function as desired on at
least GNU/Linux and Solaris. Also changes the autoconf build to prefer local
zlib and libpng source, and cleans up some variable names. Patch by Raph
Levien from 7.20. (sjpegc.c [1.4.2.2]: 2002/04/10 01:44:27 giles)

FontBBox_as_Metrics2 was set when charcode string is decoded into CIDs.
"glyphshow" bypasses such decoding procedure, thus FontBBox_as_Metrics2 is

Fixes problems:
	- Fixes the gdevx.o command line in the case when AC_PATH_X sets
x_includes to the empty string. Fixes SF #530429. (Makefile.in [1.1.4.4],
configure.ac [1.4.4.4]: 2002/03/28 19:35:58 raph)
	- Uses a default 'src' setting for PSRCDIR in the autoconf build
with a shared libpng, as we do with zlib, preventing compiler confusion from
empty -I lines. Partial fix for SF bug #514898. (configure.ac [1.4.4.5]:
2002/03/28 20:37:33 giles)
	- improves X11 path settings in the autoconf build. We use
AC_PATH_XTRA instead of the previous "is it null" hack with AC_PATH_X. The
new macro also defines some additional libraries that may need to be
included. We currently don't use this information. (Makefile.in [1.1.4.5],

Replace Windows icons with new versions that include 48x48 pixel and 32-bit

Propagate autoconf build updates from HEAD: Allow shared jpeg since
non-baseline dctencoded data is now vanishingly rare. Prefer local source of
libjpeg, libpng and zlib to shared versions if it's available. Add the
standard gcc cflags only if we're using gcc and it don't error on them. Also
look for current-version-named third-party libraries to save a step.

<h1><a name="Version7.04"></a>Version 7.04 (2002-01-30)</h1>

<p>
This is a security update of Ghostscript. A number of maintenance
fixes and new features have been added.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>A rather serious security hole, where PostScript code could cause
arbitrary commands to be executed, has been patched.

<li>There is also a new -DPARANOIDSAFER option, which locks down
reading of arbitrary files.

<li>This release integrates the IJS driver, which makes it much easier
to add and upgrade printer drivers without needing to recompile
Ghostscript.

<li>There is a configure script for automatically configuring the
makefile on Unix platforms. Those who enjoy the fun of hand-editing
the makefile are still welcome to do so.

<li>The usual bug fixes.

</ul>

<p>
The following SourceForge bug numbers are currently open: (todo)

<h3><a name="7.04_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>

<p>
No incompatible changes have been recorded for this version. Authors
of drivers with potential security implications are encouraged to review
the security changes, however.

<pre>



<h2><a name="7.04-Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Improve security in a (mostly) backward compatible fashion adding
more flexible file access paths (PermitFile...) as user paramters and adding
the facility to return to NOSAFER mode after running jobs (files/procedures)
in SAFER mode. Also adds a -dPARANOIDSAFER command line option that only
allows reading files from %stdin, paths specified on LIBPATH, FONTPATH and
/GenericResourceDir or /FontResourceDir. Improve security for device related
access to the file system and to pipes by allowing the dangerous parameters
to be locked (for example, OutputFile). The locking is performed after
command line parameters are established. This should address SF bug #474582
and eliminate the need for the RedHat PARANOIDSAFER patch.
(doc/Language.htm [1.34.2.1], doc/Use.htm [1.33.2.1]: 2002/01/25 06:33:08

Removes the admonishment to update PVERSION and JVERSION from the Makefile
documentation. The build dependencies were removed earlier to reduce user
confusion; they're currently vestigial in expectation of future build
requirements. This is the second half of the fix for sf bug #457838.
(doc/Make.htm [1.36.2.1]: 2001/10/24 22:29:29 giles)

Adds a link to the v7.xx history files. (doc/News.htm [1.90.2.2]: 2001/10/24

Fixes problems:
	- the icclib makefile comments were out of date; the build rule
referred to gs_stdio_h, which no longer exists; the build rule for gsicc.o

	- Fix for #474544. Corrects inability to convert valid DeviceN tint
transform functions into type 4 functions. Valid operator names were not
being recognized unless the tint transform function had been bound. One of
two fixes required for this problem. Customer #710. (int.mak [1.50.2.1]:

problem. This fix creates a type 0 function which implements a "color cube"
for those tint transform functions which cannot be converted into a type 4

effort. This revision will make the buildcolorcube operator into a more
general buildsampledfunction. This will allow its use in other situations.

<h1><a name="Version7.03"></a>Version 7.03 (2001-10-20)</h1>

<p>
This is a fully tested, stable release of Ghostscript. It fixes quite a
few issues with 7.02.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>Integration of icclib 2.0.

<li>There was at least one embarassing pdfwrite bug, now fixed.

<li>Significant shading speedups, especially for worst-case files
such as Coons01.ps.

<li>The stdio logic is a lot more robust. 7.02 had some problems,
especially with trying to set stdin to non-blocking.

<li>The usual bug fixes. In particular, regression testing against
7.00 shows only one serious regression (035-01.ps), and numerous
progressions.

Fixes problems:
	- cvs2hist no longer worked in Python 2.1 and later: the regex and
regsub modules were superseded by re, and append() no longer accepted
multiple arguments to create a tuple. The fixes are backward compatible for
all versions of Python from 1.5 on. (toolbin/cvs2hist.py [1.7]: 2001/09/23
04:45:10 lpd)
	- The previous update to make cvs2hist use Python's re module rather
than the obsolete regex and regsub modules didn't change the code to use
match objects when necessary. Finishes fixing SourceForge #462777.
(toolbin/cvs2hist.py [1.8]: 2001/09/23 20:43:16 lpd)
	- Some print statements for debugging were accidentally left in the
code. (toolbin/cvs2hist.py [1.9]: 2001/09/23 21:05:12 lpd)
	- Committing in . Modified Files: gs/src/gp_stdia.c
gs/src/openvms.mmk gs/src/ziodevs.c patches for OpenVMS (openvms.mmk [1.10]:
2001/09/24 10:47:06 joukj)
	- Fixes for stdin as a result of using callouts. Use unbuffered
read, not non-blocking read. Change gp_stdin_read to use file pointer not
handle. Remove gp_stdin_init since we don't need to set non-blocking. Change
gp_stdin.c to use fread/fwrite to be more portable. Flush redirected stdout
correctly. Added casts to fix compiler warnings in dxmain.c. Corrected
header dependencies. Fixes SourceForge bug #467787. (dvx-tail.mak [1.5],

it!!!! (openvms.mmk [1.12]: 2001/10/15 10:24:21 joukj)
	- When building gsx and gsc, use the GS makefile macro as the shared
library name to link against, not a hard coded gs. (unix-dll.mak [1.6]:
2001/10/17 10:11:23 ghostgum)
	- Removes cheq.ps from list of example files installed.
(unixinst.mak [1.20]: 2001/10/17 19:48:36 raph)
	- uses concrete color space of alternate color space, rather than
simply alternate color space, to determine target color space for
concretizing /All colors. Fixes regression of non-sepqxd2distiller.pdf, for
which those color spaces differed. (gscsepr.c [1.13]: 2001/10/21 06:02:21
 raph)
	- Updates icclib to version 2.0, and integrates icclib changes. In
particular, icclib now accesses Ghostscript streams through the clean
icmFile object interface, rather than previous hack. Removes remnants of
previous hack, including gs_stdio.h header file and sread() and swrite()
functions in stream.c. (lib.mak [1.53]: 2001/10/19 21:52:50 raph)
	- Documentation and version number change in preparation for 7.03
release. (version.mak [1.36]: 2001/10/20 08:44:31 raph)
	- Updates default MSVC_VERSION to 6. (msvc32.mak [1.20]: 2001/10/20

allows gsx to be used without an X display. Partial fix for SourceForge bug
#450933. (dxmain.c [1.5]: 2001/10/12 11:10:37 ghostgum)

	- Proposed log message: Fix: Callout implementation of %stdin,
%stdout and %stderr now correctly allocates the streams in system memory.
This avoids a crash during garbage collection seen during frequent

(ziodevsc.c [1.3]: 2001/10/15 21:44:42 ghostgum)
	- When using STDIO_IMPLEMENTATION=, call gp_stdin_read with a file

avoid wasting CPU. (dxmain.c [1.7]: 2001/10/20 08:22:05 ghostgum)

set the memory device width and height to zero to prevent drawing on it.
Always call the display_size callback to prevent a lockup in the caller, and
if there is no memory tell the caller that the width and height are zero.

<h1><a name="Version7.02"></a>Version 7.02 (2001-09-22)</h1>

<p>
This is a prerelease of Ghostscript, in preparation for a forthcoming
fully tested, supported 7.0x release. We are skipping the 7.01 release
number because that number is now associated with CVS versions.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>Compile and portability fixes, including the dreaded time.h
problem that affects up-to-date Linux builds.

<li>Big improvements in stdio, including a new -sstdout= redirect
switch. In addition, reading from stdin uses nonblocking I/O, so the
ugly -_ workaround is no longer necessary.

<li>Substantial pdfwrite improvements.

<li>128-bit encrypted files are now supported.

<li>The usual bug fixes.

</ul>

Release issues that will be fixed before next fully supported version:

<ul>

<li> Update icclib to 2.0.

<li> Update hpijs and Omni glue to latest versions.

<li> Make sure all source files are referenced in Develop.htm.

</ul>

</pre><h2><a name="7.02-Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Removing the dependence of graphic library on PS interpreter.
Source Forge bug #415003. (lib.mak [1.48]: 2001/04/20 09:38:39 igorm)
	- Undoes makefile breakage introduced in previous version (for VMS).
(icclib.mak [1.3], lib.mak [1.50]: 2001/04/24 18:36:55 raph)
	- !ifndef COMPILED_INITS instead of !ifndef COMPILE_INITS Discovered
fixing bug #414985 from anonymous user (msvclib.mak [1.13]: 2001/04/28
00:53:46 alexcher)
	- Optimization for shading fill. The general path filling algorithm
subdivides fill region with trapezoid or rectangle subregions and then
paints each subregion with given color. If the color is shading, each
subregion to be subdivided into areas of constant color. But with radial
shading each area is a high order polygon, being subdivided into smaller
subregions, so as total number of subregions grows huge. Faster processing
is done here by changing the order of subdivision cycles : we first
subdivide the shading into areas of constant color, then apply the general
path filling algorithm (i.e. subdivide each area into trapezoids or
rectangles), using the filling path as clip mask. Source Forge bug #414022.
(lib.mak [1.51]: 2001/05/10 18:36:40 igorm)
	- Adobe PhotoShop 5+ duotone code assumes that setcolor operator
calls tint transform function if source colors don't make a subset of device
colors. Bug #224056, Customer #150 (int.mak [1.47]: 2001/06/07 14:48:24
alexcher)
	- index.html and gs.css weren't being copied to the installed
documentation directory. (unixinst.mak [1.19]: 2001/07/25 21:10:39 giles)
	- define previously undefined make variables. DISPLAY_DEV in
unix-gcc.mak. gdevdsp_h and gdevdsp2_h in int.mak. Add missing iref.h
dependency for idisp. Bug #415006. (devs.mak [1.46], int.mak [1.48],
unix-gcc.mak [1.22]: 2001/08/01 08:58:49 ghostgum)
	- Link Linux shared object as position independent code, instead of
just compiling the modules as position independent. Adds prefix to shared
object recursive make to allow install to a temporary location while
building a distribution. (unix-dll.mak [1.3]: 2001/08/01 09:42:01 ghostgum)
	- allow any value of JVERSION in the platform-specific makefiles to
reduce user confusion over minor version naming. We continue to support only
libjpeg v6*. Sourceforge bugs #457617 and #457838, September 2001.
(jpeg.mak [1.4]: 2001/09/05 21:46:35 giles)
	- Fix for MS-Windows graphics library. Remove references to
interpreter from gp_check_interrupts function in library. Make gslib.c
access gs_stdin not stdin. Correct the build paths for graphics devices. Add
missing graphics devices. (msvc32.mak [1.18], msvclib.mak [1.16],
winlib.mak [1.11]: 2001/09/22 07:07:02 ghostgum)
	- Prevent memory corruption when reading %statementedit. Allocate
lineedit buffer in correct memory space. Line being assembled is stored in a
PostScript string during callouts, so prevent zfilelineedit from reading
more than max_string_size bytes. Allocate extra space for trailing new-line
for statementedit, rather than fiddling the string length which broke when
sreadline reallocated the string. (int.mak [1.50]: 2001/09/22 07:26:45
ghostgum)
	- pdfwrite failed to recognize several of the standard screen spot
functions: Ellipse, Round, and Diamond weren't implemented, and several of
the others didn't match the PostScript implementation because of
float/double discrepancies. Also, pdfwrite wrote out halftone screens using
the adjusted ("actual") frequency and angle values rather than the requested
values. Fixes SourceForge #446676. (devs.mak [1.47]: 2001/09/22 16:27:04

This file is a new utility intended for debug. It is not yet ready for prime
time, but is available for whoever wants to fix it. The main problems are:
1. It doesn't work for files that use chained filters such as [
/ASCII85Decode /FlateDecode ] 2. The PDF files that are written are
sometimes broken. GS gets an xref problem. This second problem may actually
due to lib/pdfwrite.ps since even when no conversion is done, the file is
bad. (toolbin/pdfinflt.ps [1.1]: 2001/05/31 04:54:51 rayjj)

To reduce redraw flicker, do not allow Windows to erase the background since
we paint it ourselves. Paint areas outside the page with the window
background colour or light grey. Save and restore window size using
registry. Add "Paste" to system menu of text window. Make error message box
a child of text window to avoid it appearing behind the text window. To
allow user to read the error message, the text window is not automatically
destroyed in the event of an error. The user must close text window using
close button or system menu. If text window closed, return e_Fatal to poll
function to provide a cleaner exit without a stack dump. (winint.mak [1.8]:

The Unix shared object loader 'gsx' depends on Gtk+ which causes it to fail

The Unix shared object loader 'gsx' depends on Gtk+ which causes it to fail

Fixes problems:
	- Empty pages included a Contents entry whose value was an empty
array: the spec allows this, and AR3 and 4 accept it, but AR5 rejects it.
(gdevpdf.c [1.34]: 2001/06/29 06:52:13 lpd)
	- When tiling with a bitmap, the /Type entry in the Pattern resource
was written twice. (Minor file size problem only, not a functional problem.)
(gdevpdfb.c [1.5]: 2001/06/29 17:04:17 lpd)
	- Some poorly designed PDF tools couldn't handle the fact that the
Contents stream of each page was not surrounded by q/Q. (The PDF spec does
not require this.) Fixes SourceForge bug #231390. (gdevpdfu.c [1.16]:
2001/07/02 18:07:55 lpd)
	- pdfwrite didn't set returned.current_char, so the "current
character" for kshow was 0 or a random value. Fixes SourceForge bug #420933.
(gdevpdfs.c [1.5]: 2001/07/02 19:09:23 lpd)
	- When producing text in a Type 3 (bitmap) font and using TL and '
for Y positioning, emitting a horizontal space character reset
text.use_leading, causing the line to be positioned incorrectly. Fixes
SourceForge bug #427159. (gdevpdft.c [1.33]: 2001/07/04 16:47:33 uid22160)
	- When producing text using a Type 3 (bitmap) font, the TL command
was used (incorrectly) when the new text position was directly below the
current text position, not (correctly) when the new text position was
directly below the beginning of the current text line. Fixes SourceForge bug

	- Scaled fonts with PaintType = 2 (stroked) were painted with
incorrect stroked width. (gdevpdfs.c [1.6]: 2001/07/04 21:57:02 uid22160)
	- pdfwrite generated masked images, a PDF 1.3 feature, even when
CompatibilityLevel &lt; 1.3. Fixes item (2) of SourceForge bug #414104.
(gdevpdfj.c [1.7], gdevpdfv.c [1.6]: 2001/07/07 19:15:51 lpd)
	- pdfwrite could write out a Pattern image too large for Acrobat

	- MSVC requires that a label not be the last thing in a block.
(gdevpdfv.c [1.9]: 2001/07/08 13:46:25 lpd)
	- The algorithm for scaling down user coordinates to fall within
Acrobat Reader's limitations didn't work properly for stroked paths with
anisotropic CTMs, possibly producing large coordinates that led Acrobat (but

(gdevpdfd.c [1.16]: 2001/07/27 22:28:31 lpd)
	- Some error codes were ignored, masking errors in writing embedded
fonts. (gdevpdfe.c [1.10]: 2001/07/31 06:32:42 lpd)
	- ICCBased color spaces were copied to the output even if the output
level was 1.2 (ICCBased color spaces were introduced in PDF 1.3).
(gdevpdfc.c [1.16]: 2001/08/02 20:29:07 lpd)
	- If an image used a color space that couldn't be represented in
PDF, an invalid file was produced, rather than falling back to the default
representation as tiny rectangles. (bug introduced by H. Blischke's color
space fix) (gdevpdfi.c [1.24]: 2001/08/03 16:12:16 lpd)
	- Type 1 fonts that did not use the standard 1000-unit cell, such as
some fonts in PostScript files produced by Windows NT 4.0, were written with
an incorrect FontMatrix. (The output was visually correct, because the font
size was scaled to compensate.) Fixes SourceForge #439474.

embedded multiple times. Partially fixes SourceForge #438957.

crashed pdfwrite. Fixes SourceForge #461330. (gdevpdfv.c [1.10]: 2001/09/15
06:12:29 lpd)
	- pdfwrite failed to recognize several of the standard screen spot
functions: Ellipse, Round, and Diamond weren't implemented, and several of
the others didn't match the PostScript implementation because of
float/double discrepancies. Also, pdfwrite wrote out halftone screens using
the adjusted ("actual") frequency and angle values rather than the requested

	- If a 'restore' had to restore page device parameters, it did so
before rather than after restoring the state of VM, possibly creating
dangling references. Fixes SourceForge #230694, #414588, #444565.

	- Ignore white space between %%DocumentData: and argument. Fix: Set
dsc-&gt;preview correctly to DOS EPS if both DOS EPS and EPSI previews are
present. Update to latest dscparse.c/h used in GSview. Change dscparse to
mark internal functions "dsc_private" not "private", so it can be compiled

	- The problem was a rangecheck error being reported in
.setdevicenspace with PDF files. The cause of the problem was not allowing
multiple copies of the name /None in DeviceN colorant specification. This is
the first of two fixes for SF bugs 427165 (customer #1110) and 438682.

	- If MaxLocalVM user parameter is set, perform garbage collection

issued even if a garbage collection would have freed enough memory to stay
below the MaxLocalVM limit. (ireclaim.c [1.3]: 2001/09/05 17:50:36 rayjj)
	- Prevent memory corruption when reading %statementedit. Allocate
lineedit buffer in correct memory space. Line being assembled is stored in a
PostScript string during callouts, so prevent zfilelineedit from reading
more than max_string_size bytes. Allocate extra space for trailing new-line
for statementedit, rather than fiddling the string length which broke when
sreadline reallocated the string. (zfile.c [1.11], ziodev.c [1.6]:

Patch from Mr. Toshiya Suzuki : Implementing multi-dimensional CID ranges,
and fixing bugs about decoding text string with CID font : (1) when GS
consumes undefined byte sequence (which cannot be mapped to some glyphs), GS
aborts. (2) when selected CID font lacks the glyph for requested CID, GS
aborts. (3) "notdefrange" defines SINGLE CID for undefined byte sequences in
specified range, but current GS implementation take it as an offset to
calculate MULTIPLE CID. (4) "cidrange" operators accept only full range
specification (&lt;0000&gt; to &lt;FFFF&gt;) or 8 bit width range
(&lt;xxyy&gt; to &lt;xxzz&gt;). Source Forge bug #415163.

	- Optimization for shading fill. The general path filling algorithm
subdivides fill region with trapezoid or rectangle subregions and then
paints each subregion with given color. If the color is shading, each
subregion to be subdivided into areas of constant color. But with radial
shading each area is a high order polygon, being subdivided into smaller
subregions, so as total number of subregions grows huge. Faster processing
is done here by changing the order of subdivision cycles : we first
subdivide the shading into areas of constant color, then apply the general
path filling algorithm (i.e. subdivide each area into trapezoids or
rectangles), using the filling path as clip mask. Source Forge bug #414022.

fix: If the ICC profile fails to load completely, or is missing a WhitePoint
a valid default is needed to prevent a divide by zero. The WhitePoint is the
same as the ICC default illuminant, D50. SourceForge bug 432130 for Artifex
customer #150 as well as bug 427156, customers #880 and #1110 and bug
414984. (gsicc.c [1.3]: 2001/06/12 15:32:20 rayjj)

If an ICC color space failed to load, Acrobat Reader uses the alternate
color space. Previous implementation ignored errors during load and used the
partial ICC space. This change signals an error and uses the alternate space
by catching the error in a stopped context in the interpreter.
(gsicc.c [1.4]: 2001/06/12 16:02:39 rayjj)

Patch from Mr. Toshiya Suzuki : Implementing multi-dimensional CID ranges,
and fixing bugs about decoding text string with CID font : (1) when GS
consumes undefined byte sequence (which cannot be mapped to some glyphs), GS
aborts. (2) when selected CID font lacks the glyph for requested CID, GS
aborts. (3) "notdefrange" defines SINGLE CID for undefined byte sequences in
specified range, but current GS implementation take it as an offset to
calculate MULTIPLE CID. (4) "cidrange" operators accept only full range
specification (&lt;0000&gt; to &lt;FFFF&gt;) or 8 bit width range
(&lt;xxyy&gt; to &lt;xxzz&gt;). Source Forge bug #415163. (gdebug.h [1.3],

Notes that the 'foreign' member of the vm_spaces.memories allocator array is
not used (always zero). (gsgc.h [1.3]: 2001/06/17 04:03:52 lpd)

Makes embedded CFF fonts in PDF files omit the FontBBox if it is [0 0 0 0].
This should only be a minor optimization, but SourceForge bug #428595 claims
that Acrobat Reader cares. (gdevpsf2.c [1.13]: 2001/07/06 05:17:31 lpd)

Changed debugging flag variables to const. (gshtscr.c [1.6],
gsmdebug.h [1.3], gxchar.c [1.5], gxclimag.c [1.3], gxclip.c [1.4]:

Changed fill patterns for unallocated memory to const (gsmemory.c [1.3]:

These changes were originally put into the GS_6_5 branch on 2001/03/13. They
are needed for using the current version of teh graphics library with the
PCL6 code. Short description of changes: stat_.h: Added definition of
stat_is_dir for use with MSVC. Not used in Ghostscript. gsptype1.c: Changes
in image_PaintProc. This routine is used in gs_makepixmappattern.
gs_makepixmappattern is only used in test8 (in gslib.c - a test module) and
gs_makebitmappattern_xform. gs_makebitmappatern_xform is not used in
Ghostscript. It is used in pcl6. (gsptype1.c [1.3]: 2001/08/07 22:13:29

Improves documentation for gs_string and gs_bytestring types; adds
gs_free_[const_]bytestring procedures. (gsmemory.c [1.4], gsmemory.h [1.3],
gstypes.h [1.3]: 2001/08/25 06:46:21 lpd)

Speed up reading stdin when using callouts. Add platform-specific functions
for reading stdin, to allow non-blocking reading of stdin if supported.
Fixes Sourceforge bug #416973. (gp.h [1.7], unistd_.h [1.3]: 2001/09/15

Improves poor performance of shadings in some cases, notably Coons01.ps.
Long, thin triangles are now cut in half, rather than into four smaller
triangles. Thus, the mesh is more regular. (gxshade4.c [1.5]: 2001/09/22

	- Setting an ICC color space now invalidates the joint cache, so
that TransformPQR gets computed. The profile is explicitly loaded so that
