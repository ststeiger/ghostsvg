<h1><a name="Version6.53"></a>Version 6.53 (2002-02-13)</h1>

<p>
This is a maintanence release of the stable GPL branch of Ghostscript.

<p>
Major changes include:
<ul>

<li>A rather serious security problem has been fixed, where PostScript
code could allow the execution of arbitrary commands.

<li>There is also a new -DPARANOIDSAFER option, which locks down
reading of arbitrary files.

<li>Important improvements in asian language support contributed by the
gs-cjk team.

<li>This release integrates the IJS driver, which makes it much easier
to add and upgrade printer drivers without needing to recompile
Ghostscript.

<li>This release integrates a client for the Gimp-Print (stp)
library of high-quality inkjet drivers.

<li>Also new in this release is a configure script (generated by GNU
Autoconf) for automatically configuring the makefile on Unix platforms.
Those who enjoy the fun of hand-editing the makefile are still welcome
to do so.

</ul>

There are also the usual minor big fixes.

<h2><a name="6.53_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

<p>
No incompatible changes have been recorded for this version.
Authors of drivers with potential security implications are
encouraged to review the security changes, however.
