</PRE>

Aladdin Ghostscript 5.10, originally released in November 1997, has now been
released with the GPL as GNU Ghostscript 5.10.  It is available for
downloading from
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/gnu/gs510/">
	ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/gnu/gs510/</A>
<BR>
We hope that FSF or volunteers will propagate it to the GNU mirrors shortly,
to alleviate the load on the Wisconsin server, and will make RPMs and other
compiled versions.
<P>
Please DO NOT report problems with GNU Ghostscript 5.10 to Aladdin, unless
we accidentally did something really stupid like omit a crucial file.  To
the best of our ability and subject to the constraint that there are only 24
hours in a day, problems in Ghostscript 5.10 have been fixed in Ghostscript
5.50, released in September 1998 with the Aladdin Free Public License and
scheduled for re-release in September 1999 with the GPL.  If you have a
problem with GNU Ghostscript 5.10, we suggest you seek help on the
gnu.ghostscript.bug newsgroup.
<P>
