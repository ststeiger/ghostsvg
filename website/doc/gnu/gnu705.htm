<h1>
 Release of GNU Ghostscript 7.05
</h1>

<p>
We're pleased to announce the availablity of GNU Ghostscript 7.05, 
the first GPL release of the stable 7.0x branch, 54 weeks after the 
first AFPL release.
</p>
<p>
The 7.05 release is available from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1897&release_id=86074">sourceforge</a> 
and 
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/gs705/">wisc.edu</a> 
as per usual.
</p> 
<p>The new release is also available from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ghostscript/ghostscript-7.05.tar.gz">gnu.org</a> and its <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">mirrors</a>.
</p> 
<p>
New in this release is a port of the gs-cjk team's asian language 
improvements from the 6.5x branch, a major improvement over 7.04. 
PDF handling in general is much better than in the previous 
GNU release (6.53) and the portability of the autoconf build system 
is much improved. Of course there are the usual minor bugfixes as well. 
Free Software users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.
</p> 
<p>
Thanks to everyone for their hard work in making this release possible
