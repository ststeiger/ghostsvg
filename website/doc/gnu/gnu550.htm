Subject: GNU Ghostscript 5.50 is available
</PRE>
GNU Ghostscript 5.50 is now available.  The files for this release are now
available from
  <A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/gs550/">
	ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/gs550/</A>
<BR>
The Web pages have not yet been updated.
<P>
Please note that the tarballs are now named gnu-gs-* rather than
ghostscript-*, to avoid confusion with Aladdin Ghostscript.
<P>
The content of GNU Ghostscript 5.50 is Aladdin Ghostscript 5.50 with two
enhancements:
<UL>
	<LI> Approximately a dozen bug fixes that were posted on the Web site
	after the release.

	<LI> The expanded URW++ fonts with the full Adobe PostScript 3
	character set (the additions are mostly Eastern European
	characters).
</UL>
Please do not report problems with GNU Ghostscript 5.50 to Aladdin
Enterprises (unless we did something really obvious and stupid in packaging
the release): GNU Ghostscript releases are Free software and come with NO
WARRANTY and NO SUPPORT.  Aladdin Enterprises only accepts problem reports
for the most recent release of Aladdin Ghostscript (currently Aladdin
Ghostscript 6.0, released on February 3).
<P>
We have established a GNU Ghostscript project on SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net), a well-maintained site that offers free accounts
and tools for Free and Open Source software development.  We will soon
populate this project with the GNU Ghostscript 5.50 sources.  If you are
interested in joining the developers' group for this project, giving you
write access to the CVS repository and to the bug data base, please contact
us.
