<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of GNU Ghostscript 6.51. This
release
makes available the new features of the 6.xx series to the entire GNU
community. 
<p> This release contains all of the bug fixes committed to the stable
branch since
the 6.50 release. In addition, it contains integration for the HPIJS and
Omni driver suites. 

<p> As of this release, the GS_6_5 branch in SourceForge CVS is covered
under the GPL. Fixes and integration patches may be committed here, while
active development of Ghostscript continues in the HEAD branch. 
<p> I'm looking forward to the Linux distributions picking up this version!
<p> The files can be downloaded from SourceForge here:
