   Ghostscript is a software package that interprets Adobe's 
   PostScript (TM) language, including a few additional features. 
   For further information read the file language.doc from the current 
   Ghostscript distribution.

<H2>
Subject: 1.8 Why do my fonts look ugly at larger point sizes?
</H2></A>
<P>
   Older versions of Ghostscript came with fonts that look ugly 
   (jagged text), when you use them at larger sizes. 
   Fonts downloaded as part of the postscript file look fine. 
   This is because the fonts coming with old versions of 
   Ghostscript are overworked bitmapped fonts. 
   The solution is to get high quality fonts, for example the 
   Adobe Type Manager fonts. Also third-party Type 1 fonts from 
   Bitstream, URW, Soft Horizons and many other suppliers work. 
   Please read your corresponding font licences. 
<P>

   Aladdin Ghostscript 4.0 and later come with a set of high 
   quality fonts, made available by URW.

<P>
<HR><A NAME="1.11">
<H2>
Subject: 1.11 Without FTP access to the Internet. How can I get Ghostscript?
</H2></A>
<P>
   GNU Ghostscript is included in the GNU distribution from the Free Software 
   Foundation; e-mail to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu for information on ordering 
   their tapes, floppies, or CD-ROMs.  Ghostscript is generally included in 
   less-commercial Unix systems such as Linux and BSDI, and also appears on 
   some freeware CD-ROMs.  Some commercial services like Compuserve and 
   Genie, and many privately run bulletin board systems (BBSs), make 
   Ghostscript available for downloading, but their copies are likely to be 
   incomplete or obsolete.
<P>
   If you do not have convenient access to the Internet, you can order 
   Aladdin Ghostscript on a CD-R disc, along with some useful related 
   programs and documentation: for more information, see
<PRE>
	http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/cd.html
</PRE>
   or send e-mail to Russell Lang (see the e-mail address above).
   Please note that this is not "commercial licensing"; you are still
   getting freely redistributable software, with no support and no warranty.
<P>
<HR><A NAME="1.12">
<H2>
Subject: 1.12 Why won't Aladdin Ghostscript read piped PDF files?
</H2></A>
<P>
   Portable Document Format is a file format which contains forward
   and backward links.  It is not a stream format like PostScript.
   You cannot pipe PDF files to the stdin of Ghostscript.  Instead
   you must either give the PDF filename on the command line, or
   use it as the argument of the Ghostscript run command.
<P>
<HR><A NAME="1.13">
<H2>
|Subject: 1.13 How do you display PDF files with Ghostview?
</H2></A>
<P>
   Since Ghostview pipes PostScript files to Ghostscript, you
   cannot start Ghostview as
<PRE>
          ghostview file.pdf
</PRE><P>
   Instead there are several options:
<P>
   1. Tanmoy Bhattacharya has written some patches for Ghostview 1.5
   that allow it to read and display PDF files.  These are available 
   from:
<A HREF="ftp://gita.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/gv1.5gs3.33hack.tar.gz">
       ftp://gita.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/gv1.5gs3.33hack.tar.gz
</A>
<P>
   2. Start Ghostview as follows:
<PRE>
          ghostview -arguments file.pdf quit.ps
</PRE><P>
   This will allow you to display a PDF file, but you won't be able
   to jump to particular pages.  Use Tanmoy's code if you want that
   facility.
<P>
   3. With ghostscript 3.53 or later, create an `index file' by saying
<PRE>
          pdf2dsc file.pdf file.pdx
          ghostview file.pdx
</PRE>
   This lets you display particular pages of a pdf file even without a
   patched version of ghostview. The index file isn't a postscript
   version of the pdf file, just a series of commands to ghostscript
   saying `display page 1 of file.pdf', `display page 2', and so on.
<P>
   4. Use GV, a modified version of Ghostview available from

   When you run Ghostscript on AXP (Alpha) machines, text does not 
   appear properly (or does not appear at all) on the screen. 
   Versions of Ghostscript through 2.6.1 have a number of bugs that

   starting with 3.0 will work properly on 64-bit machines.

   There is a chance that you can not link gs, because your enviroment

   the kernel. For further reference read the manpages.

   This is a Ghostscript bug that was fixed by a patch released

   Some servers do not implement bitmap/pixmap displaying properly. 
   This may show up as white or black rectangles where characters

</H3></A>
<P>
   On DOS systems using the Borland compiler, if Ghostscript gives you 
   a 'limitcheck in setdevice' error, it may mean Ghostscript's standard 
   buffer size wasn't large enough.  Likewise, if Ghostscript gives you a 
   'VMerror in setdevice' error, it means the buffer size was too large. You 
   can use the -dBufferSpace= switch to set the buffer size to a different 
   value, e.g., 
<PRE>
     -dBufferSpace=50000 
</PRE>
   The default value is 25000; the smallest value Ghostscript accepts is 
   10000; the largest valid value is 65000.

<P>
   wmake.exe is a normal DOS application with a 64K limit. You

<P>
   The most common problem is that you have not set up your ghostscript 
   command line correctly in the "Options | Ghostscript Command" menu item. 
   The GSWIN command should look like: 
<PRE>
     D:\GS\GSWIN -ID:\GS;D:\GS\GSFONTS

Subject: 2.7.2 MS Windows GSWIN fails with exit code -13 or -15.
</H3>

   This is due to a bug in GSview 1.3 and earlier, and Aladdin 
   Ghostscript 3.51 and earlier.  This error is caused when a display 
   driver returns a depth other than 1, 4, 8, 16 or 24.
   As a work around, in GSview set "Media | Depth" to something
   other than default, preferably the value that best matches
   your display driver.  For Ghostscript, use the -dBitsPerPixel=XX
   switch, using one of the values listed above.

  Because of actions by CompuServe and Unisys related to a patent that claims
  to cover the data compression method used in GIF, anyone who distributes any
  new GIF software (even readers, but definitely software that creates GIF
  files) after January 1, 1995 may be subject to legal action if they do not
  get a license from Unisys, and/or unpredictable payment requirements if they
  do get such a license.  I cannot run the risk of having this happen.  If you
  wish to run this risk, you may extract the GIF software (gdevgif.c and a
  small part of devs.mak) from Aladdin Ghostscript 3.12, which was originally
  released in 1994.

Subject: 3.2 The spacing of characters / words / margins on the display
              is wrong, what can I do?
</H2></A>
<P>
   This is almost always caused by differences between the character 
   widths that were used to format the document and the character widths 
   of the fonts installed in your system.  (This only affects the 
   display, and only with window systems, not with DOS.)  If this 
   happens, invoke Ghostscript with the -dNOPLATFONTS switch, or
   (on X Windows) set

     Ghostscript*useExternalFonts: false

   in your X resource file. 
<P>
   For more information about fonts on the display, please read the 
   first sections of fonts.doc.

Subject: 3.3 On my H-P LaserJet, why do I only get a partial page of output, 
              or a single page gets split across two sheets?

   Printing on a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet at full resolution (300 DPI) 
   requires a printer with at least 1.5 Mb of memory.  150 DPI printing 
   requires only .5 Mb.  You can select 150 DPI printing with the command 
   line switch

     -r150

   (This is not necessary on DeskJet printers.)
