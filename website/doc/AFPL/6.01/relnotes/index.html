<H2>Post-release news for Aladdin Ghostscript 6.01 has moved</H2>

<HR>

<P>
We no longer post bug information or fixes here: we are now using the bug
tracking system on SourceForge, where we have also moved our development
source code.  For more information, please visit
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1897">
http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1897</a>.

<p>
We are aware that the SourceForge bug tracking system has some serious
shortcomings:

<ul>

<li>It doesn't provide a standard (selectable or searchable) way to identify
in what release a bug was reported or fixed.

<li>It doesn't support classifying bugs by platform.

<li>It doesn't provide a convenient way to link from a closed bug report to
the changes that fix the bug.

<li>It doesn't provide any search facilities.

</ul>

<p>
We are planning to work with SourceForge to upgrade their system to be more
useful, in these ways among others.
