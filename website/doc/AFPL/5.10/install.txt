********
******** How to install Ghostscript ********
********

There are 3 separate items that you must have available in order to be able
to run Ghostscript:

	(1) The Ghostscript executable file(s) -- on some operating
	systems, more than one file is required.  These are entirely
	platform-specific.  See below for details.

	(2) Initialization files that Ghostscript reads in when it
	starts up.  These are the same on all platforms.

	(3) Fonts, for rendering text.  These are platform-independent,
	but if you already have fonts of the right kind on your platform,
	you may be able to use them.  See below for details.  See the
	companion document fonts.txt for more information about fonts.

The initialization files (2) are the same on all platforms:

	- gs_*.ps (see psfiles.txt for the full list), unless Ghostscript was
	  compiled using the "compiled initialization files" option.

	- pdf_*.ps, if Ghostscript was compiled with the ability to
	  interpret PDF files (pdf.dev included in FEATURE_DEVS).

	- Fontmap, unless you plan to always invoke Ghostscript with the
	  -dNOFONTMAP switch.

See the search algorithm section of use.txt for a description of the search
algorithm used to find these files.

The per-platform descriptions that follow tell you where to install these
files.

MS-DOS
------

You need the following files to run Ghostscript:
	GS386.EXE
	DOS4GW.EXE

You should install all the files except the fonts in C:\GS, and the
fonts in C:\GS\FONTS.

If you have Adobe Type Manager fonts installed on your system, and you wish
to use them with Ghostscript, you may wish to replace the FONTMAP file with
FONTMAP.ATM, and to add to the environment variable GS_LIB the name of the
directory where the fonts are located (see below for more information about
GS_LIB).  Before you do this, please read carefully the license that
accompanies the ATM fonts; Aladdin Enterprises takes no responsibility for
any possible violations of such licenses.  Similarly, if you have Adobe Type
Basics, you may wish to replace FONTMAP with FONTMAP.ATB.  Finally, if you
have neither ATM nor ATB but you have Adobe Acrobat installed, you can use
the 14 Acrobat fonts in place of the ones provided with Ghostscript by
removing the following entries from FONTMAP:
	Courier, Courier-Bold, Courier-BoldOblique, Courier-Oblique
	Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica-BoldOblique, Helvetica-Oblique
	Symbol
	Times-Bold, Times-BoldItalic, Times-Italic, Times-Roman
	ZapfDingbats
and adding the Acrobat fonts directory to GS_FONTPATH.

MS Windows
----------

Win32s or Windows 95 or Windows NT is required.  You need the following
files to run Ghostscript:
    GSWIN32.EXE
    GSWIN32C.EXE
    GSDLL32.DLL
    GS16SPL.EXE  (Win32s only)

You should install all the files except the fonts in C:\GS, and the fonts in
C:\GS\FONTS.
  
The GSview previewer contains an installation program to install and
configure GSview and Ghostscript for Win32.  Information on GSview is
available from:
    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/

See under "MS-DOS" above for information about using Adobe Type Manager,
Adobe Type Basics, or Adobe Acrobat fonts.

If your system uses TrueType fonts, you can get them converted to a
Ghostscript-compatible format at the time you select your "printer" by
doing the following:

1)	Open control panel and double click on the printers icon.
2)	Select your Postscript Printer.
3)	Choose Setup.
4)	Choose Options.
5)	Choose Advanced.
6)	At the top of the Dialog Box you will see TrueType Fonts
	Send to Printer As: <drop down menu>
	Choose Adobe Type 1.
7)	Uncheck Use Printer Fonts for All TrueType Fonts
	and Use Substitution Table.
8)	OK.
9)	OK etc.

That's it!  Your TrueType fonts will automatically be downloaded in your
PostScript file for Ghostscript to use.

For printer devices, the default output is:
  the default printer (Win95 or WinNT)
OR
  prompt for a printer port (Win32s).
This can be modified as follows.
  -sOutputFile="LPT1:"
       Output to named port.
  -sOutputFile="\\spool\printer name"   (Win95 or WinNT only)
       Output to named printer.
  -sOutputFile="\\spool"                (Win95 or WinNT only)
       Prompt for printer name.  Local printers only are supported.
For Win32s, make sure that gs16spl.exe is in the same directory
as gswin32.exe.
  

OS/2 2.x
--------

The Ghostscript OS/2 implementation is designed for OS/2 2.1 or later.
A few people have used it successfully under OS/2 2.0, but it has had 
very little testing.

You need the following files to run Ghostscript:
	GSOS2.EXE - this is a text application that will run windowed or
		full screen.
	GSDLL2.DLL - this is a Dynamic Link Library that must be in the same
		directory as GSOS2.EXE or on the LIBPATH.
	GSPMDRV.EXE - this is an "external driver" used by the "os2pm"
		device, which is normally the default device and which
		displays output in a Presentation Manager window.
		GSPMDRV.EXE must be located in the same directory as
		GSOS2.EXE or on the PATH.

GSOS2.EXE, GSDLL2.DLL and GSPMDRV.EXE are compiled using EMX/GCC 0.9b.  
You must have the EMX DLL's on your LIBPATH.  These are available from
	ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/emx09b/emxrt.zip

The system menu of the Ghostscript Image window includes a "Copy" command
to copy the currently displayed bitmap to the Clipboard.

OS/2 comes with some Adobe Type Manager fonts. If you wish to use these
with Ghostscript, you should replace the FONTMAP file with FONTMAP.OS2,
and add to the environment variable GS_LIB the name of the directory where
the fonts are located, usually c:\psfonts.  (see below for more
information about GS_LIB).  Before you do this, please read carefully the
license that accompanies the ATM fonts; Aladdin Enterprises takes no
responsibility for any possible violations of such licenses.

Since GSOS2.EXE is not a PM application, it cannot determine the depth of
the PM display.  You must provide this information using the
-dBitsPerPixel option.  The default is 8 bits/pixel.  Valid values are 1,
4, 8 & 24.
  For monochrome VGA use      -dBitsPerPixel=1
  For standard VGA screen use -dBitsPerPixel=4
  For 256 colour SVGA use     -dBitsPerPixel=8
A command file gspm.cmd containing the following line may be useful:
  @c:\gs\gsos2.exe -Ic:/gs;c:/gs/fonts;c:/psfonts -sDEVICE=os2pm 
      -dBitsPerPixel=8 -sPAPERSIZE=a4 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8

While drawing, the os2pm driver updates the display every 5 seconds.  On
slow computers this is undesirable and a different interval can be
specified in milliseconds with the -dUpdateInterval option.  The default
is -dUpdateInterval=5000; to disable update use -dUpdateInterval=0.

Standard VGA is very slow due to double buffering to avoid bugs and due to
1 plane to 4 plane conversion.  Use a 256 color display driver by
preference.  Many display drivers have bugs which cause 1 bit/pixel
bitmaps to be displayed incorrectly.

GSOS2.EXE and GSPMDRV.EXE will stay in memory for the number of minutes
specified in the environment variable GS_LOAD.

If you run GS386 in the OS/2 2.0 or 2.1 DOS Box, you must select the
"ENABLED" setting for the DPMI_DOS_API option of the DOS Box.  GS386
will not run with the "AUTO" setting.

For printer devices, output goes to the default queue.
To print to a specified queue, use -sOutputFile=\\spool\NullLPT1
where NullLPT1 is the queue physical name.

Unix
----

You need the following file to run Ghostscript:
	gs

Installing Ghostscript on a Unix system requires compiling it first: please
read the Unix section(s) in make.txt for more information, especially
regarding how to decide which makefile to use and how you may need to edit
it.  After building, execute
	make install

The makefile installs all the files, except the fonts, in /usr/local or
various subdirectories thereof.  The fonts should be installed in
/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts.  Consult the makefile for more details.
If you have Adobe Acrobat installed, you can use the 14 Acrobat fonts in
place of the ones provided with Ghostscript by removing the following
entries from Fontmap:
	Courier, Courier-Bold, Courier-BoldOblique, Courier-Oblique
	Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica-BoldOblique, Helvetica-Oblique
	Symbol
	Times-Bold, Times-BoldItalic, Times-Italic, Times-Roman
	ZapfDingbats
and adding the Acrobat fonts directory to GS_FONTPATH.

NOTE: The syntax of the 'install' command varies unpredictably between Unix
systems.  If your system has an 'installbsd' program, edit the definition of
INSTALL in the makefile to change 'install' to 'installbsd' before you run
'make install'.

VMS
---

You need the following executable file to run Ghostscript:
	GS.EXE

Installing Ghostscript on a VMS system requires compiling it first.

You should install all the files, including the fonts, in the same directory
as the executable and initialization files.  By default, this is the
directory in which you did the compilation.  Consult the makefile
(OPENVMS.MAK) for more details.

If you have DECWindows/Motif installed, you may wish to replace the FONTMAP
file with the file FONTMAP.VMS.  Read the comment at the beginning of the
latter file for more information.
