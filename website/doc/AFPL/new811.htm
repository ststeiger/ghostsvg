<p>
Artifex Software, Inc and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the availability of Ghostscript 8.11.
<blockquote>
<p>
Ghostscript 8.11 is the first stable release since 8.00,
building on the features in the 8.10 beta, and with numerous 
additional fixes and improvements.
In particular, font rendering is greatly improved (thanks to Igor
Melichev's new hinting code), PDF 1.4 transparency rendering is much
more likely to be correct, and there is better support for CID font
substitution. Processing of incorrect and broken PDF files is also
improved, including files corrupted xref tables and non-ASCII font
names. Many other smaller fixes are included.
<p>
Users may want to experiment with the new -dAlignToPixels=0 setting,
which enables subpixel positioning for antialiased font rendering.
<p>
<strong>Incompatible changes:</strong>
<p>
The mechanism for locating resources has changed since 8.00. See the usage documentation for details of the new mechanism.
<p>
Ghostscript now runs in save level 1 by default, which has changed since 8.10.  Jobservers will need to use the -dNOOUTERSAVE option to restore the old behavior.
