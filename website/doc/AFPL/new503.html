Subject:          Release of Aladdin Ghostscript 5.03
</PRE><P>
Aladdin Ghostscript 5.03 is now available from

<PRE>
	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs503/">ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs503/</A>
		ghostscript-5.03.tar.gz (source code)
		ghostscript-5.03pc.tar.gz (PC executables and run-time files)
</PRE>[plus the following that are identical to their 5.0 through 5.02 counterparts:]<PRE>
		ghostscript-5.03libpng.tar.gz (libpng 0.96)
</PRE>[plus the following that are identical to their 5.0 counterparts:]<PRE>
		ghostscript-5.03gnu.tar.gz (a few GNU-licensed drivers)
		ghostscript-5.03zlib.tar.gz (zlib 1.0.4)
</PRE>[plus the following that are identical to their 4.03 and 5.0 counterparts:]<PRE>
		ghostscript-5.03jpeg.tar.gz (IJG JPEG 6a)
		ghostscript-fonts-std-5.03.tar.gz
		ghostscript-fonts-other-5.03.tar.gz
</PRE>
ZIP files for PC platforms are not available yet.  However, since all the
files needed to run on PCs are in the pc.tar.gz archive, you might consider
getting MS-DOS versions of gzip and tar, both of which are available free.
<P>
Highlights of this release, relative to 4.03, include:
<UL>

<LI> Support for PDF 1.2 (Acrobat 3.0), including CFF (compressed
embedded) fonts.

<LI> Support for CIDFonts and CMap-keyed fonts.

<LI> (Optional) ability to read MS-DOS EPSF files.

<LI> Output in JPEG format.

<LI> Output in PCL XL ("PCL 6") format.

<LI> Distillation of PDF or PostScript to PostScript or EPS
(without preview).

<LI> Much improved distillation of PostScript to PDF.

<LI> New, more flexible architecture for color inkjets (uniprint driver).

<LI> Support for in-RAM band lists compressed with zlib, for
embedded applications.

<LI> Support for compilation with Microsoft Visual C++ on 32-bit
MS Windows platforms.

<LI> Support for GNU make on OpenVMS.

<LI> First-level validation (no crashes or unexpected errors) with
	the Genoa PostScript Level 2 CET by an independent third party.
</UL>
<P>
We have deliberately dropped the following:
<UL>

<LI> Support for 16-bit MS-DOS and MS Windows environments.

<LI> The pstoppm.ps file, which has been obsoleted by the p*m drivers
	for 2 releases.
</UL>
<P>
For the next release,
we would also like to support the Cygnus
cygwin32 port of gcc,
since Cygnus has now made the necessary software available for
free redistribution: see
<A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/</A>.
If you would like to help us by porting Ghostscript to this
platform, or
if you have opinions about what compilers we should
support, please let us know at
<A HREF="mailto:ghost@aladdin.com">&lt;ghost@aladdin.com&gt;</A>.
<P>
We are also planning to drop support for building on OpenVMS using DCL
scripts: starting with the next release, you will need to acquire, make a
couple of minor patches in, and build GNU make in order to build Ghostscript
on OpenVMS.  (You won't be required to use gcc to build Ghostscript: you
will still have the choice of DEC C, VAX C, or gcc.)  If you have opinions
about this, please let us know.  We considered supporting MMK or MMS, and
decided in favor of GNU make primarily because it would mean the least
divergence between the VMS makefiles and the ones already used for all other
platforms.
<P>
Please report problems in the 5.03 release by e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:ghost@aladdin.com">&lt;ghost@aladdin.com&gt;</A>
using the bug-form.txt reporting form that you will find in the Ghostscript
fileset.  We don't promise to investigate every problem, but if you provide
us with a fully filled-out reporting form, the chances are much better that
we will look into it.
<P>
Aladdin is committed to continuing the development of Ghostscript as a fully
competitive commercial-quality product as well as an unsupported, freely
redistributable package for end users.  If you are, or you know someone who
might be, a hardware, software, or system OEM interested in licensing
Ghostscript for incorporation in a commercial product (either embedded or
host-based), please contact our exclusive licensing partner, Artifex
Software Inc., at
<A HREF="mailto:info@artifex.com">&lt;info@artifex.com&gt;</A>.
