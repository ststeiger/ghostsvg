and <a href="http://www.artifex.com">Artifex Software Inc.</a>
are pleased to announce the release of AFPL Ghostscript version 7.03. 
This release is a maintenance release in the 7.0x branch.

<p> Source tarballs and Windows executables and, for the first time in
the 7.x series, a MacOS shlib build are available from the
