Subject:          Release of Aladdin Ghostscript 4.03, replacing 4.02
</PRE>
There was a fatal bug in Aladdin Ghostscript 4.02, introduced by (of course)
a last-minute "fix", that caused Ghostview to hang.  We have therefore
withdrawn 4.02 and replaced it with 4.03.
<P>
Aladdin Ghostscript 4.03 is now available from:

<PRE><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs403/">
	ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs403/</A>
		ghostscript-4.03.tar.gz (source code)
		ghostscript-4.03pc.tar.gz (PC executables and run-time files)
		ghostscript-4.03gnu.tar.gz (a few GNU-licensed drivers)
[plus the following that are identical to their 4.0 and 4.01 counterparts:]
		ghostscript-4.03jpeg.tar.gz
		ghostscript-4.03libpng.tar.gz
		ghostscript-4.03zlib.tar.gz
		ghostscript-fonts-std-4.03.tar.gz
		ghostscript-fonts-other-4.03.tar.gz
Also, the archive
		ghostscript-changes-4.01-4.03.tar.gz
contains only those files that changed from 4.01 to 4.03.  (This is *not* a
'patch' file: it contains entire changed files.)
</PRE>
If you already acquired 4.02 and compiled it yourself, you only need to get
the changes archive and unpack it on top of 4.02.  If you need the PC
executables, you need the new PC archive.
<P>
MS-DOS and MS Windows .zip archives will appear in this directory in about
2-3 weeks.  There will be another announcement when this happens.
<P>
Like 4.02, 4.03 is a bug fix release for Aladdin Ghostscript 4.01 (released
on July 10).  It also includes the ability (through a third-party patch
available from a file server outside the U.S.) to read encrypted PDF files
(but not to break the encryption scheme), and a very limited ability to read
PDF 1.2 (Acrobat 3.0) files.
<P>
There are a few other new features: please see the NEWS file for details.
This release is not supposed to have any non-backward-compatible changes.
<HR>
Please report any problems to ghost@aladdin.com using the bug report form in
the fileset (bug-form.txt).  Also please bear in mind that Ghostscript is
free software and comes with NO WARRANTY and NO SUPPORT, so we can't
guarantee that we will fix any reported problems.  If you are an OEM
commercial licensee, of course, this does not apply to you.  If you would
like to license Aladdin Ghostscript 4.03 for commercial distribution, either
as a new licensee or as an upgrade to an existing license, please contact
our licensing agent, Artifex Software Inc., 
at <A HREF="mailto:info@artifex.com">&lt;info@artifex.com&gt;</A>.

From a previous announcement:
<P>
Highlights of 4.0:
<UL>

<LI> New scripts and utilities:
 <BR><TT>pdf2ps input.pdf output.ps</TT>
  Converts PDF to PostScript, similar to Adobe's Acrobat
  Exchange.
 <BR><TT>ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf</TT>
  Converts PostScript to PDF, similar to Adobe's Acrobat
  Distiller.  (It doesn't do a very good job just yet.)

<LI> setpagedevice is (finally) implemented.

<LI> AccurateScreens is now implemented.

<LI> The poor-quality free fonts have been replaced by good ones.

<LI> Anti-aliased text and graphics are available for PBM output and for
display output on MS Windows.

<LI> PostScript Type 42 (embedded TrueType) fonts are fully supported (but the
output quality is not very good, because the current TrueType rasterizer
ignores hints).  Real TrueType fonts (.TTF) are also supported if Ghostscript
is compiled with the ttfont feature included (which is the default on MS
Windows platforms).

<LI> The driver interface has been expanded so that drivers can capture
graphical "objects" at a high level rather than as rasters.  See drivers.txt
and gxdevice.h for details.
