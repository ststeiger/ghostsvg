<h2>
What is Ghostscript
</h2></a>
<p>
  Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:
<ul>
<li> 
    An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language,
    with the ability to convert PostScript language files to
    many raster formats, view them on displays, and print them on
    printers that don't have PostScript language capability
    built in;
<li> 
    An interpreter for Portable Document Format (PDF) files,
    with the same abilities;
<li> 
    The ability to convert PostScript language files to PDF
    (with some limitations) and vice versa; and
<li> 
    A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement
    the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the
    PostScript language.
</ul>

<h2>
What is the difference between AFPL Ghostscript 
                 and GNU Ghostscript.
</h2></a>
<p>
   AFPL Ghostscript is distributed with a license called the Aladdin 
   Ghostscript Free Public License that allows free use, copying, and
   distribution by end users, but does not allow commercial distribution. 
   AFPL Ghostscript was previously known as Aladdin Ghostscript.
<p>
   GNU Ghostscript is distributed with the GNU General Public License, 
   which allows free use, and free copying and redistribution under
   certain conditions (including, in some cases, commercial distribution).

<h2>
How do I display a particular page?
</h2></a>
<p>
   You need a previewer based on Ghostscript. These are described 
   in the Ghostscript 
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/cvs/New-user.htm">
     New-user.htm
</a>
<p>
   Some previewers are:

   Ghostview 1.5 (X11)

<h2>
Without FTP access to the Internet. How can I get Ghostscript?
</h2></a>
<p>
   GNU Ghostscript is included in the GNU distribution from the Free Software 
   Foundation; e-mail to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu for information on ordering 
   their tapes, floppies, or CD-ROMs.  Ghostscript is generally included in 
   less-commercial Unix systems such as Linux and BSDI, and also appears on 
   some freeware CD-ROMs.  
<P>
   If you do not have convenient access to the Internet, you can order 
   AFPL Ghostscript on a CD-R disc, along with some useful related 
   programs and documentation: for more information, see
<a href="http://www.ghostgum.com.au/cd.htm">
	http://www.ghostgum.com.au/cd.htm
</a>
   or contact Russell Lang at the address below.
   Please note that this is not "commercial licensing"; you are still
   getting freely redistributable software, with no support and no warranty.
<P>

<h2>
Why won't Ghostscript read piped PDF files?
</h2></a>
<p>
   Portable Document Format is a file format which contains forward
   and backward links.  It is not a stream format like PostScript.
   You cannot pipe PDF files to the stdin of Ghostscript.  Instead
   you must either give the PDF filename on the command line, or
   use it as the argument of the Ghostscript run command.

<h3>
Why do I get "Can't allocate backing pixmap" messages?
</h3></a>
<p>
   Some servers do not implement backing pixmaps properly, or do not
   have enough memory for them.  If you get strange behavior or "out
   of memory" messages, try setting the useBackingPixmap resource
   to false.
<p>
<h3>
Why do I get white or black rectangles where characters 
                should appear?
</h3></a>
<p>
   Some servers do not implement bitmap/pixmap displaying properly. 
   This may show up as white or black rectangles where characters 
   should appear, or characters may appear in "inverse video" (e.g.,
   white on a black rectangle).  If this happens, try setting 
   the useXPutImage resource to false.

<h3>
Which versions of Ghostscript are available for MS-DOS?
</h3>
<p>
   If you are running 32-bit Windows you don't want a DOS version.
   Ghostscript for MS-Windows includes a Windows console mode 
   executable named gswin32c.exe.
<p>
   The last 16-bit DOS version was either GS 2.61 or 3.33. 
   The last 32-bit DOS extended version was GS 5.10.

<h2>
Why isn't GIF supported in Ghostscript?
</h2></a>
<p>
  L. Peter Deutsch of Aladdin Enterprises writes:
<p>
  Because of actions by CompuServe and Unisys related to a patent that claims
  to cover the data compression method used in GIF, anyone who distributes any
  new GIF software (even readers, but definitely software that creates GIF
  files) after January 1, 1995 may be subject to legal action if they do not
  get a license from Unisys, and/or unpredictable payment requirements if they
  do get such a license.  I cannot run the risk of having this happen.  If you
  wish to run this risk, you may extract the GIF software (gdevgif.c and a
  small part of devs.mak) from Aladdin Ghostscript 3.12, which was originally
  released in 1994.
<p>
  Consider using alternative image formats such as PNG or JPEG.
