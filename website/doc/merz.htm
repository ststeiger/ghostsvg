Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is available for
all common and most esoteric platforms. Ghostscript is a powerful program for
which highly portable C source code is available. I wrote a comprehensive
Ghostscript user manual which is also part of my latest book (German:
&#187;Die PostScript- und  Acrobat-Bibel&#171;
English edition called &#187;PostScript  &amp;
Acrobat/PDF&#171;). The Manual covers many aspects of
Ghostscript, including installation, configuration, build process, applications,
and troubleshooting. This manual is freely available as a PDF file in several
languages:

<P>Important note:</P>
<P>You can view and print the Ghostscript manual with
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/">Adobe Acrobat </A>software
(available for many platforms) or Ghostscript itself (available for even more
platforms). GSview for Windows and OS/2 can be used for viewing and printing the
manual. Note that Ghostview for X11 has some problems displaying
landscape PDFs, so you better use Ghostscript in a standalone fashion.
You can use the pdf2ps shell script to instruct Ghostscript to
convert the manual to PostScript:</P>
