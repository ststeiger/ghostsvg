  RedMon - Redirection Port Monitor</h1><p>
Transparent PostScript printing from Windows 95/98 and NT.
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <b>RedMon</b> port monitor redirects a special printer port 
to a program. 
<b>RedMon</b> is commonly used with Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer to emulate a PostScript printer. 
<p><b>RedMon</b> can be used with any program that accepts data on 
standard input. 
<p>Using <b>RedMon</b> you create a redirected printer port.  
If you connect a Windows printer driver to the redirected printer port, 
all data sent to the redirected port will be forwarded by <b>RedMon</b> 
to the standard input of a program.  
The output of this program can be sent to different printer port, 
or the program can generate whatever output it desires.
<p>A PostScript Windows printer redirected to a RedMon port can shared  
on a network. 
When this printer is configured to use Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer, it appears as a PostScript printer to other network clients. 
<p>RedMon can also be used with an lpr client to provide transparent
access to printers on Unix hosts.  This is useful under Windows 95/98.
Windows NT already has an lpr port monitor so there is no point in
using RedMon for this.  Another alternative is to use RedMon with 
<a href="http://www.concentric.net/~ravitz/">PrintGLN</a>, an HPGL
pen plotter emulator.

<p>If you use the Ghostscript mswinpr2 device with RedMon under 
Windows NT, please read these <a href="muir.htm">notes</a>.

<h2>Availability</h2>
RedMon works under Windows 95/98, Windows NT 4.0, 2000 and XP.

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li> User interface is unfriendly.
<li> On Windows Terminal Server or Windows XP with fast user switching, 
  the "Prompt for filename" dialog will appear on the console or first
  session, not the current session.  If you know how to set the session
  for displaying windows, please send me email.
<li> Writing files to network shares may not work.
<li> Environment variables are not replaced in the program arguments.
<li> Windows 2000 and XP have a job name as the document title, 
 not the original document name.  This is not something that can be 
 fixed in RedMon.
<li>gsprint can't find any printers because RedMon runs as the default
 user which doesn't have any printers.  Copy the printer configuration
 in the registry from the current user to the default user.  
 This problem is related to 
 <a href="muir.htm">using mswinpr2 on Windows NT</a>.

<h2>Beta version</h2>
<p>
Beta test version 1.6 is available from
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/beta/redmon16b.zip">
ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/beta/redmon16b.zip</a>.
</p>
<p>
Most of the changes are internal - there has been a major 
reorganisation of the code to allow parts of RedMon to be 
reused in other port monitors.
Changes that should be visible are the addition of the
environment variables REDMON_SESSIONID (for Windows Terminal
Server) and REDMON_FILENAME.  When replacing %d with the
name of the document, RedMon now removes characters that
are invalid for use in a filename.
Attempting to print to a RedMon port from a printer 
with bi-directional support enabled will now always fail.
</p>
<p>
The beta version will expire on 31 December 2001.
