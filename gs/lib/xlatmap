% xlatmap - the map of translation tables for various kinds of fonts.
%
% It specifies Deconings to be used with FAPI-handled fonts.
% If a font contain multiple character mapping tables,
% this gives priorities for choosing a specific table from the font -
% just using the order of entries of this map.

% This file is allowed to customize by users without special agrement.
% Please keep obvious format of this file.
% Stings and manes must not contain zero bytes and must not be empty.

% The map contains entries for each kind of fonts, being handled by
% any font rendering plugin. The key of the entry is
% the kind of fonts. The value is array of pairs.
% The first element of pair is a string which encodes identifier of
% character mapping table. The format of the first element 
% depends on the kind of fonts, and should be recognized by
% font rendering plugins. The second element is name of
% Decoding resource. If resource is not available,
% definefont will fail. Note that currently we supply insufficient
% decoding resources, as well as insufficient entries in this map.
