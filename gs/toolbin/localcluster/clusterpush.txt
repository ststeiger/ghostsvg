The clusterpush.pl script allows you to run a cluster regression using
code that has not been committed to svn.  It's supposed to be a
replacement for clusterpush.sh.

Usage:

  clusterpush.pl [type [user]]

Where type is either gs or ghostpdl.  If you do not specify 'type'
clusterpush.pl will check the current directory name and if it is gs or
ghostpdl will use that, otherwise it terminates with an error.

And user is one of alex, giles, henrys, ken, marcos, masaki, mvrhel,
ray, or tor.  If you don't specify 'user' clusterpush.pl uses the value
of $USER.  This makes sense on Linux and Mac OS X and probably cygwin,
but I'm not sure what happens when run under Windows.  If you prefer
a different default username than the one listed above please let me know.

You need to run clusterpush.pl from the top level directory (the same
directory from where you normally run 'make').  There isn't any error
checking for this, so be careful.

Results will be sent via email after the run is completed, which takes
about 15 minuts, presuing the cluster isn't busy. Your code is compared
to the most recent baseline, so for meaningful results you will want
to sync your code with head if recent changes to head have resulted in
regression differences.

BTW, no checking is done to make sure that you actually are the user you
claim to be, so you can use this script as a primitive denial-of-service
attack by flooding someone's mailbox with regression results (and by
'flooding' I mean one email every 15 minutes).

Finally, the first time you run clusterpush.pl it will take a really
long time to rsync your source to the master machine and then from the
master to the nodes.  After that things will go much quicker (unless,
like me, you accidently leave giant .ppm files in the current directory).

One last thing, the code runs the PostScript/EPS/PDF tests for Ghostscript
changes and the PCL5/PCL6/XPS/SVG tests for GhostPDL changes.  This isn't
ideal, since a Ghostscript change can break any of the GhostPDL languages
and it's a waste of time to test XPS if a change is made to the GhostSVG
specific source.  If enough people complain I'll eventually fix this.
