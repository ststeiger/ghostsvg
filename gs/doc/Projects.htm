<p>
There are many projects that would improve Ghostscript and that we would
like to do, but for which we don't have enough resources.  If you would like
to take responsibility for any of these projects, please <a
href="mailto:ghost@aladdin.com">contact us</a>.

<h1><a name="Platforms"></a>Additional platforms</h1>

<p>
We would like Ghostscript to work with the free <b><tt>emx/gcc</tt></b> and
<b><tt>rsx</tt></b> libraries, to provide an alternative DOS, Windows
95/98/NT, and OS/2 implementation that requires no proprietary, commercial
compilers.  We think Ghostscript's existing OS/2 makefile already includes
most of what is needed.  If someone is willing to do the work, we will be
happy to include this in our list of supported platforms and to distribute
the makefiles.  If interested, please consult

<blockquote>

<h1><a name="Drivers"></a>Additional drivers</h1>

<p>
We would like to provide (Adobe) PrintGear and (H-P) PPA output drivers for
Ghostscript, but the specifications for these protocols are not published.
If you can provide them to us without violating any agreements, please let
us know.  (Some work has already been done on reverse-engineering these
protocols, but we don't have references to it.)

<h1><a name="Extensions"></a>Functional extensions</h1>

<p>
There is a project to create a GNU implementation of the OPENStep API, which
involves extending Ghostscript to provide the full functionality of Adobe's
Display PostScript system with some of the NeXT extensions.  For more
information, please contact Net-Community &lt;<a
href="mailto:scottc@net-community.com">scottc@net-community.com</a>&gt;.
