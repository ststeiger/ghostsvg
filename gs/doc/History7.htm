Within each release, news appears in the following order: Incompatible
changes, Documentation, Procedures, Utilities, Drivers, Platforms, Fonts,
PDF writer (included under Drivers through fileset 5.88), Interpreter,
Streams (included under Interpreter through release 2.9.9), Library.
Changes marked with a * were made available as patches to a previous
release.

<hr>

<h1><a name="Version7.20"></a>Version 7.20 (2002-03-29)</h1>

<p>
This is the first development release after the 7.0x series. While
it is a development release, it is likely to be quite stable and
robust, largely thanks to automated regression testing.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>Support for external font renderers such as Agfa UFST.

<li>An optional "diskn" feature that emulates the "%disk" devices
found on some Adobe printers.

<li>The <tt><b>-dSAFER</b></tt> flag now tightens read access to
arbitrary files, as well as write access. Thus,
<tt><b>-dSAFER</b></tt> in this release is equivalent to
<tt><b>-dSAFER -dPARANOIDSAFER</b></tt> in 7.04. This will break some
viewers, notably gv.

</ul>

<p> In addition, the following improvements have been merged from
the 7.04 release:

<ul>

<li>A rather serious security hole, where PostScript code could cause
arbitrary commands to be executed, has been patched.

<li>This release integrates the IJS driver, which makes it much easier
to add and upgrade printer drivers without needing to recompile
Ghostscript.

<li>There is a configure script for automatically configuring the
build system on Unix platforms. Those who enjoy the fun of hand-editing
the makefile are still welcome to do so.

</ul>

<p>
And, of course, the usual bug fixing and performance enhancement.

<p>
There has also been considerable development of our DeviceN
implementation and related color work on a private branch. These new
features are <em>not</em> included in this release. We expect to merge
them into the main branch soon.

<p>
There exists another private branch which integrates PCL and PostScript/PDF
in the same executable. Again, that work is not reflected in this
release.

<h2><a name="7.20_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

<pre>
(Interpreter)
	- Updates clients and implementors for the new glyph outline data
structure.
	- -dSAFER flag now restricts read access to arbitrary files in
addition to restricting write access.
	- While not strictly an incompatible change, authors of drivers
with potential security implications are encouraged to review the
security changes, including the LockSafetyParams mechanism.

(Library)
	- Changes all procedures for getting glyph outline data to return
the data by storing it into a gs_glyph_data_t structure that includes memory
management information.  This is a NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change to both
implementors and clients.  It corrects a significant design error: formerly
these procedures encoded memory management information in their return code,
which was obscure and error-prone.  See src/gsgdata.[hc].

Fixes problems:
	- Include gs_resmp.ps into the prelude with ADDMOD rather than
.runlibfile (suggested by Raymond J. Johnston), and increase MSVC compiler
heap for building gs_init.c with COMPILE_INITS=1. Source Forge bug "[ 526192
] Broken COMPILE_INITS". (msvccmd.mak [1.9]: 2002/03/06 08:55:16 igor)

spurious errors due to timezone differences (toolbin/pre.tcl [1.6]:
2002/03/29 00:44:34 giles)
	- gsfont.h didn't define gs_matrix as an opaque type, causing
clients of gsfont.h to include gsmatrix.h unnecessarily. (lib.mak [1.68]:
2002/03/29 00:48:21 lpd)
	- Makes pathname manipulation in check_dirs.py and check_docrefs.py
more portable and robust. (toolbin/tests/check_dirs.py [1.6],
toolbin/tests/check_docrefs.py [1.7]: 2002/03/29 02:32:54 raph)

Makes 'save' create inner chunks for all chunks with at least a minimum
amount of free space (currently defined statically as 500 bytes), rather
than only for the chunk that was open at the time of the save. This makes
all of this space available for allocation within the scope of the save,
which can substantially improve memory utilization. (isave.c [1.6]:

Fixes problems:
	- Converting Type 1 to Type 2 fonts didn't adjust the coordinates of
stem hints, which are relative to the l.s.b. in Type 1 but not in Type 2.
(First part of two-part fix for SourceForge #520718.) (gdevpsfx.c [1.14]:
2002/02/22 07:07:47 lpd)
	- The Type 2 CharString interpreter ignored many hints. (Second part
of two-part fix for SourceForge #520718.) (gstype1.c [1.11],
gxhint2.c [1.5], gxtype1.h [1.10]: 2002/02/22 15:28:21 lpd)
	- Makes the standard memory manager scan all chunks, not just the
currently open one, for available free space. This is a long-planned,
long-overdue improvement that can improve memory utilization dramatically.
(gsalloc.c [1.14]: 2002/02/22 23:39:20 lpd)
	- Prevent image interpolation if the target device has less than 4
bits per component. This prevents interpolation from causing 'noise'
(stripes, shadows, etc.) in the output when the device is halftone dithered.
SourceForge bug 525708 for Artifex customer #710. (gxiscale.c [1.6]:
2002/03/06 19:15:15 ray)
	- The formula for dy6 in Type2 hflex1 instruction was wrong. Source
Forge bug #530136 "hflex1 arguments misinterpreted". Thanks to Felix Pahl
(fpahl) for spotting this. (gstype2.c [1.17]: 2002/03/20 20:25:33 igor)
	- Fixes a number of problems with Type11 incremental glyph loading
with MetricsCount=2. Thanks to Brian Stell for the patch.

	- (1) real_widths were missed in public_st_pdf_font; (2)
pdf_finalize_font_descriptor was called twice (form pdf_font_notify_proc and
from pdf_write_font_resources), if a font is garbage-collected after
pdf_close. Source Forge bug "[ 531983 ] ps2pdf coredumps on this ps file".

had to include gsmatrix.h. (gxfont.h [1.9]: 2002/03/29 00:41:39 lpd)

<h1><a name="Version7.03"></a>Version 7.03 (2001-10-20)</h1>

<p>
This is a fully tested, stable release of Ghostscript. It fixes quite a
few issues with 7.02.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>Integration of icclib 2.0.

<li>There was at least one embarassing pdfwrite bug, now fixed.

<li>Significant shading speedups, especially for worst-case files
such as Coons01.ps.

<li>The stdio logic is a lot more robust. 7.02 had some problems,
especially with trying to set stdin to non-blocking.

<li>The usual bug fixes. In particular, regression testing against
7.00 shows only one serious regression (nonsepqxd2distiller.pdf),
and numerous progressions.

</ul>

<p>

Fixes problems:
	- cvs2hist no longer worked in Python 2.1 and later: the regex and
regsub modules were superseded by re, and append() no longer accepted
multiple arguments to create a tuple. The fixes are backward compatible for
all versions of Python from 1.5 on. (toolbin/cvs2hist.py [1.7]: 2001/09/23
04:45:10 lpd)
	- The previous update to make cvs2hist use Python's re module rather
than the obsolete regex and regsub modules didn't change the code to use
match objects when necessary. Finishes fixing SourceForge #462777.
(toolbin/cvs2hist.py [1.8]: 2001/09/23 20:43:16 lpd)

	- When the display device fails to allocate memory for the bitmap,
set the memory device width and height to zero to prevent drawing on it.
Always call the display_size callback to prevent a lockup in the caller, and
if there is no memory tell the caller that the width and height are zero.

(gdevpdff.c [1.22]: 2001/10/05 05:40:41 lpd)
	- pdfwrite allowed AutoRotatePages to override DSC comments rather

than one pixel was too conservative, as it took the fill adjust into
account. (gxshade4.c [1.6]: 2001/10/01 21:16:47 raph)
	- Correct inverted Decode cases of ImageType 4 color range masks for
the Monochrome single bit per pixel case. Fixes SourceForge bug #462319 for
Artifex customer #671. (gxifast.c [1.4]: 2001/10/06 03:27:57 rayjj)
	- Fix : More error tolerance in type2 charstring interpreter. 2/2
fix for Source Forge bug #468389 "rangecheck in type2execchar". Thanks to L.
Peter Deutsch for participation and for the comment in code.
(gstype2.c [1.10]: 2001/10/12 08:55:24 igorm)
	- Fixes for stdin as a result of using callouts. Use unbuffered
read, not non-blocking read. Change gp_stdin_read to use file pointer not
handle. Remove gp_stdin_init since we don't need to set non-blocking. Change
gp_stdin.c to use fread/fwrite to be more portable. Flush redirected stdout
correctly. Added casts to fix compiler warnings in dxmain.c. Corrected
header dependencies. Fixes SourceForge bug #467787. (gp.h [1.8],
gxclutil.c [1.5], unistd_.h [1.4]: 2001/10/12 21:37:08 ghostgum)
	- Fixes reference counting for PDF 1.4 device filter stack.
Temporary patch to not free PDF 1.4 marking device for images (it was being
freed prematurely). (gdevp14.c [1.4], gsdfilt.c [1.3]: 2001/10/17 17:28:10
raph)
	- Updates icclib to version 2.0, and integrates icclib changes. In
particular, icclib now accesses Ghostscript streams through the clean
icmFile object interface, rather than previous hack. Removes remnants of
previous hack, including gs_stdio.h header file and sread() and swrite()
functions in stream.c. (gsicc.c [1.5], gsicc.h [1.3]: 2001/10/19 21:52:50

<h1><a name="Version7.02"></a>Version 7.02 (2001-09-22)</h1>

<p>
This is a prerelease of Ghostscript, in preparation for a forthcoming
fully tested, supported 7.0x release. We are skipping the 7.01 release
number because that number is now associated with CVS versions.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>Compile and portability fixes, including the dreaded time.h
problem that affects up-to-date Linux builds.

<li>Big improvements in stdio, including a new -sstdout= redirect
switch. In addition, reading from stdin uses nonblocking I/O, so the
ugly -_ workaround is no longer necessary.

<li>Substantial pdfwrite improvements.

<li>128-bit encrypted files are now supported.

<li>The usual bug fixes.

</ul>

Release issues that will be fixed before next fully supported version:

<ul>

<li> Update icclib to 2.0.

<li> Update hpijs and Omni glue to latest versions.

<li> Make sure all source files are referenced in Develop.htm.

</ul>

<p>

</pre><h2><a name="7.02-Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Removing the dependence of graphic library on PS interpreter.
Source Forge bug #415003. (lib.mak [1.48]: 2001/04/20 09:38:39 igorm)
	- Undoes makefile breakage introduced in previous version (for VMS).
(icclib.mak [1.3], lib.mak [1.50]: 2001/04/24 18:36:55 raph)
	- !ifndef COMPILED_INITS instead of !ifndef COMPILE_INITS Discovered
fixing bug #414985 from anonymous user (msvclib.mak [1.13]: 2001/04/28
00:53:46 alexcher)
	- Optimization for shading fill. The general path filling algorithm
subdivides fill region with trapezoid or rectangle subregions and then
paints each subregion with given color. If the color is shading, each
subregion to be subdivided into areas of constant color. But with radial
shading each area is a high order polygon, being subdivided into smaller
subregions, so as total number of subregions grows huge. Faster processing
is done here by changing the order of subdivision cycles : we first
subdivide the shading into areas of constant color, then apply the general
path filling algorithm (i.e. subdivide each area into trapezoids or
rectangles), using the filling path as clip mask. Source Forge bug #414022.
(lib.mak [1.51]: 2001/05/10 18:36:40 igorm)
	- Adobe PhotoShop 5+ duotone code assumes that setcolor operator
calls tint transform function if source colors don't make a subset of device
colors. Bug #224056, Customer #150 (int.mak [1.47]: 2001/06/07 14:48:24
alexcher)
	- index.html and gs.css weren't being copied to the installed
documentation directory. (unixinst.mak [1.19]: 2001/07/25 21:10:39 giles)
	- define previously undefined make variables. DISPLAY_DEV in
unix-gcc.mak. gdevdsp_h and gdevdsp2_h in int.mak. Add missing iref.h
dependency for idisp. Bug #415006. (devs.mak [1.46], int.mak [1.48],
unix-gcc.mak [1.22]: 2001/08/01 08:58:49 ghostgum)
	- Link Linux shared object as position independent code, instead of
just compiling the modules as position independent. Adds prefix to shared
object recursive make to allow install to a temporary location while
building a distribution. (unix-dll.mak [1.3]: 2001/08/01 09:42:01 ghostgum)
	- allow any value of JVERSION in the platform-specific makefiles to
reduce user confusion over minor version naming. We continue to support only
libjpeg v6*. Sourceforge bugs #457617 and #457838, September 2001.
(jpeg.mak [1.4]: 2001/09/05 21:46:35 giles)
	- Fix for MS-Windows graphics library. Remove references to
interpreter from gp_check_interrupts function in library. Make gslib.c
access gs_stdin not stdin. Correct the build paths for graphics devices. Add
missing graphics devices. (msvc32.mak [1.18], msvclib.mak [1.16],
winlib.mak [1.11]: 2001/09/22 07:07:02 ghostgum)
	- Prevent memory corruption when reading %statementedit. Allocate
lineedit buffer in correct memory space. Line being assembled is stored in a
PostScript string during callouts, so prevent zfilelineedit from reading
more than max_string_size bytes. Allocate extra space for trailing new-line
for statementedit, rather than fiddling the string length which broke when
sreadline reallocated the string. (int.mak [1.50]: 2001/09/22 07:26:45
ghostgum)
	- pdfwrite failed to recognize several of the standard screen spot
functions: Ellipse, Round, and Diamond weren't implemented, and several of
the others didn't match the PostScript implementation because of
float/double discrepancies. Also, pdfwrite wrote out halftone screens using
the adjusted ("actual") frequency and angle values rather than the requested
values. Fixes SourceForge #446676. (devs.mak [1.47]: 2001/09/22 16:27:04

This file is a new utility intended for debug. It is not yet ready for prime
time, but is available for whoever wants to fix it. The main problems are:
1. It doesn't work for files that use chained filters such as [
/ASCII85Decode /FlateDecode ] 2. The PDF files that are written are
sometimes broken. GS gets an xref problem. This second problem may actually
due to lib/pdfwrite.ps since even when no conversion is done, the file is
bad. (toolbin/pdfinflt.ps [1.1]: 2001/05/31 04:54:51 rayjj)

To reduce redraw flicker, do not allow Windows to erase the background since
we paint it ourselves. Paint areas outside the page with the window
background colour or light grey. Save and restore window size using
registry. Add "Paste" to system menu of text window. Make error message box
a child of text window to avoid it appearing behind the text window. To
allow user to read the error message, the text window is not automatically
destroyed in the event of an error. The user must close text window using
close button or system menu. If text window closed, return e_Fatal to poll
function to provide a cleaner exit without a stack dump. (winint.mak [1.8]:

Adds a C implementation of the Arcfour encryption filter. This is a
work-alike of the RC4 cipher used in PDF encryption. (int.mak [1.49],
lib.mak [1.52]: 2001/09/02 06:16:41 giles)

The Unix shared object loader 'gsx' depends on Gtk+ which causes it to fail
in an environment where X11 and Gtk+ are not available. Add a console only

array: the spec allows this, and AR3 and 4 accept it, but AR5 rejects it.
(gdevpdf.c [1.34]: 2001/06/29 06:52:13 lpd)
	- When tiling with a bitmap, the /Type entry in the Pattern resource
was written twice. (Minor file size problem only, not a functional problem.)
(gdevpdfb.c [1.5]: 2001/06/29 17:04:17 lpd)
	- Some poorly designed PDF tools couldn't handle the fact that the
Contents stream of each page was not surrounded by q/Q. (The PDF spec does
not require this.) Fixes SourceForge bug #231390. (gdevpdfu.c [1.16]:
2001/07/02 18:07:55 lpd)
	- pdfwrite didn't set returned.current_char, so the "current

(gdevpdfs.c [1.5]: 2001/07/02 19:09:23 lpd)
	- When producing text in a Type 3 (bitmap) font and using TL and '
for Y positioning, emitting a horizontal space character reset
text.use_leading, causing the line to be positioned incorrectly. Fixes
SourceForge bug #427159. (gdevpdft.c [1.33]: 2001/07/04 16:47:33 uid22160)
	- When producing text using a Type 3 (bitmap) font, the TL command
was used (incorrectly) when the new text position was directly below the
current text position, not (correctly) when the new text position was
directly below the beginning of the current text line. Fixes SourceForge bug

incorrect stroked width. (gdevpdfs.c [1.6]: 2001/07/04 21:57:02 uid22160)
	- pdfwrite generated masked images, a PDF 1.3 feature, even when
CompatibilityLevel &lt; 1.3. Fixes item (2) of SourceForge bug #414104.
(gdevpdfj.c [1.7], gdevpdfv.c [1.6]: 2001/07/07 19:15:51 lpd)

	- MSVC requires that a label not be the last thing in a block.
(gdevpdfv.c [1.9]: 2001/07/08 13:46:25 lpd)
	- The algorithm for scaling down user coordinates to fall within
Acrobat Reader's limitations didn't work properly for stroked paths with
anisotropic CTMs, possibly producing large coordinates that led Acrobat (but

gdevpdfx.h [1.30]: 2001/07/12 03:28:02 lpd)
	- pdfwrite didn't write transfer functions in the output for images,
and allowed lossy compressions on images even in the presence of peculiar
transfer functions (such as functions simulating indexed color spaces). This
fix writes transfer functions for images, prevents lossy compression if the
transfer function is not the identity, and undoes the hack that was
implemented earlier to work around this problem. Fixes SourceForge bug

gdevpdfx.h [1.31]: 2001/07/12 05:47:07 lpd)

(gdevpdfd.c [1.16]: 2001/07/27 22:28:31 lpd)
	- Some error codes were ignored, masking errors in writing embedded
fonts. (gdevpdfe.c [1.10]: 2001/07/31 06:32:42 lpd)
	- ICCBased color spaces were copied to the output even if the output
level was 1.2 (ICCBased color spaces were introduced in PDF 1.3).
(gdevpdfc.c [1.16]: 2001/08/02 20:29:07 lpd)
	- If an image used a color space that couldn't be represented in
PDF, an invalid file was produced, rather than falling back to the default
representation as tiny rectangles. (bug introduced by H. Blischke's color
space fix) (gdevpdfi.c [1.24]: 2001/08/03 16:12:16 lpd)
	- Type 1 fonts that did not use the standard 1000-unit cell, such as
some fonts in PostScript files produced by Windows NT 4.0, were written with
an incorrect FontMatrix. (The output was visually correct, because the font
size was scaled to compensate.) Fixes SourceForge #439474.

	- pdfwrite failed to recognize several of the standard screen spot

color space. It printed as white in DeviceCMYK before. Bug #423838
(gscsepr.c [1.12]: 2001/05/25 13:54:01 alexcher)
	- Prevent SEGV caused by freeing memory not owned. Variable 'code'
was overwritten, losing the get_outline return code that was needed for the
decision to free the glyph_string.data. Problem detected with PCL. Bug was
introduced in rev 1.10. (gstype42.c [1.12]: 2001/05/31 04:34:23 rayjj)
	- Include &lt;time.h&gt; as required by Debian systems with glibc
2.2. Fixes SourceForge bugs 413747, 417180, 417181, 417182. (time_.h [1.3]:
2001/06/07 21:04:52 raph)
	- FunctionType 4 functions that contained conditionals (if/ifelse)
would report the length of their symbolic definition incorrectly;
FunctionType 4 functions that had to return their symbolic definition in
pieces would loop forever. Fixes SourceForge bug #427191. (gsfunc4.c [1.6]:
2001/07/04 01:23:46 lpd)
	- Changes clip logic in gx_image_cached_char() to affect the imaging
device, so that clipping is reliably effective. Fixes SF bug #433821 (and
probably others). (gxccache.c [1.5]: 2001/07/05 20:36:55 raph)
	- Removes duplicate rc_decrement_only() in
pdf14_begin_typed_image(), so that the marking device is now deallocated
once. Fixes SourceForge bug #434705. (gdevp14.c [1.3]: 2001/07/05 23:21:00
raph)
	- Prevent non-persistent name_arrays of size==0 from causing a
VMerror if alloc of size 0 returns a NULL. Detected with
SeparationColorNames from the PCL code. (gscparam.c [1.7]: 2001/07/06
17:02:25 rayjj)
	- If the FontMatrix of a CFF CIDFont was the default [0.001 0 0
0.001 0 0], it was not written, causing the FontMatrices of the subfonts to
be scaled by 1000. (The Adobe documentation isn't at all clear about this.)
Fixes SourceForge bug #428595. (gdevpsf2.c [1.14]: 2001/07/07 06:28:08 lpd)
	- Before processing an image that uses the current color, call
gs_state_color_load to ensure that if the current color is a pattern, the
pattern is loaded. (This parallels existing code used for filling paths and
processing text.) This prevents a SEGV caused when pdfwrite dereferenced a 0
pointer to pdc-&gt;colors.pattern.p_tile. Fixes SourceForge bug #422089 for
Artifex Customer #1110. (gsimage.c [1.4]: 2001/07/10 22:04:20 lpd)
	- The algorithm for scaling down user coordinates to fall within
Acrobat Reader's limitations didn't work properly for stroked paths with
anisotropic CTMs, possibly producing large coordinates that led Acrobat (but
not Ghostscript) to display the resulting file incorrectly. Fixes
SourceForge bug #440476. (gdevvec.c [1.12], gdevvec.h [1.7]: 2001/07/12
03:28:02 lpd)
	- -sOutputFile=%stdout handling was broken by rev. 1.4 is fixed by
giving priority to iodevices when there is a leading %, but if the iodevice
is not recognized, attempting to parse as a format. Fix for SourceForge bugs
436895 and 428738, Artifex customer #680 (gsdevice.c [1.11]: 2001/07/12
14:10:55 rayjj)
	- gp_open_scratch_file concatenated the temporary directory name
with the prefix even if the prefix was an absolute path; also, it didn't
check the length of the final file name, possibly leading to memory
corruption. (gp_unifs.c [1.6]: 2001/07/15 13:57:50 lpd)
	- An incorrect optimization in the conversion of Type 1 to Type 2
CharStrings could cause character shapes to be mangled. This probably only
affected embedded fonts in PDF output. Fixes SourceForge #444374.
(gdevpsfx.c [1.9]: 2001/07/26 03:04:51 lpd)
	- Acrobat Reader would not accept embedded TrueType fonts with a
zero-length glyf table. Fixes SourceForge #429156. (gdevpsft.c [1.8]:
2001/07/30 07:03:18 lpd)
	- An embedded CFF font could not be larger than 64K. Fixes
SourceForge #445400. (gdevpsf2.c [1.15]: 2001/07/31 06:39:06 lpd)
	- For CIEBasedDEF(G) color spaces the interpolated values from the
Table need to be scaled to the range given by RangeABC. Fixes SourceForge
bug #440278 reported by Artifex customer #10. (gsciemap.c [1.6]: 2001/08/03
15:26:35 rayjj)
	- Correct a problem with white lines appearing in an image at or
near band boundaries. Problem caused by different handling for the last
image pixel at a band boundary versus the remaining pixels. Replaced it with
uniform handling. Fixes SourceForge bug #436899 reported by Artifex customer
#150. Also included are three lines of source code clean up in the same
section. (gxicolor.c [1.3]: 2001/08/06 21:22:31 dancoby)
	- Writing a Type 2 font subset with undefined glyphs in the Encoding
produced invalid output. Fixes SourceForge #451399. (gdevpsf.h [1.10],
gdevpsfu.c [1.7]: 2001/08/16 13:36:37 lpd)
	- The problem was a rangecheck error being reported in
.setdevicenspace with PDF files. The cause of the problem was not allowing
multiple copies of the name /None in DeviceN colorant specification. This is
the first of two fixes for SF bugs 427165 (customer #1110) and 438682.
(gscdevn.c [1.6], gscspace.h [1.8]: 2001/08/21 23:52:36 dancoby)
	- Most of the Type 1 hinting code was executed even when hinting was
disabled. Part 2 of a two-part fix for SourceForge #451456.
(gxhint3.c [1.3]: 2001/08/29 19:04:55 lpd)
	- Quark Xpress turns off garbage collection with -2 vmreclaim when
embedding EPS files which can lead to rampant allocation that is only
reclaimed when GC is reenabled. When the GC is disabled, reduce the
threshold from 2 Gb to 8 Mb. Fixes SourceForge bugs: 444370 and 438676.
(gsalloc.c [1.10]: 2001/09/05 17:54:31 rayjj)
	- Fixes some typos in the comment for FORCE_GC_LIMIT.
(gsalloc.c [1.11]: 2001/09/05 18:03:39 lpd)
	- Copying a parameter list failed to copy persistent aggregates if
the target list used a different allocator from the source list, possibly
causing crashes at 'restore'. Fixes SourceForge #461007. (gsparamx.c [1.4]:
2001/09/14 04:23:11 lpd)
	- The sin and cos operators in Type 4 (PostScript Calculator)
Functions expected their argument in radians, not degrees. (gsfunc4.c [1.7]:
2001/09/17 06:01:12 lpd)
	- Fix for MS-Windows graphics library. Remove references to
interpreter from gp_check_interrupts function in library. Make gslib.c
access gs_stdin not stdin. Correct the build paths for graphics devices. Add
missing graphics devices. (gslib.c [1.5]: 2001/09/22 07:07:02 ghostgum)

Changes gp_open_scratch_file() to use mkstemp() rather than mktemp() on gcc
builds, which avoids warnings. Adds CAPOPT variable to unix-gcc.mak to
select which function is used, so that builds will still succeed on systems
that don't have mkstemp(). (gp_unifs.c [1.5]: 2001/05/07 19:05:46 jackiem)

This fixes a minor omission that prevents ghostscript from building on at
least some platforms. After an #ifndef, a #define isn't done.
(gsptype2.h [1.4]: 2001/05/11 23:12:11 jackiem)

fix: If the ICC profile fails to load completely, or is missing a WhitePoint
a valid default is needed to prevent a divide by zero. The WhitePoint is the
same as the ICC default illuminant, D50. SourceForge bug 432130 for Artifex
customer #150 as well as bug 427156, customers #880 and #1110 and bug
414984. (gsicc.c [1.3]: 2001/06/12 15:32:20 rayjj)

If an ICC color space failed to load, Acrobat Reader uses the alternate
color space. Previous implementation ignored errors during load and used the
partial ICC space. This change signals an error and uses the alternate space
by catching the error in a stopped context in the interpreter.
(gsicc.c [1.4]: 2001/06/12 16:02:39 rayjj)

Patch from Mr. Toshiya Suzuki : Implementing multi-dimensional CID ranges,
and fixing bugs about decoding text string with CID font : (1) when GS
consumes undefined byte sequence (which cannot be mapped to some glyphs), GS
aborts. (2) when selected CID font lacks the glyph for requested CID, GS
aborts. (3) "notdefrange" defines SINGLE CID for undefined byte sequences in
specified range, but current GS implementation take it as an offset to
calculate MULTIPLE CID. (4) "cidrange" operators accept only full range
specification (&lt;0000&gt; to &lt;FFFF&gt;) or 8 bit width range
(&lt;xxyy&gt; to &lt;xxzz&gt;). Source Forge bug #415163. (gdebug.h [1.3],
gsfcmap.c [1.14], gsmisc.c [1.12], gxfcmap.h [1.8]: 2001/06/16 19:02:32

Notes that the 'foreign' member of the vm_spaces.memories allocator array is
not used (always zero). (gsgc.h [1.3]: 2001/06/17 04:03:52 lpd)

Makes embedded CFF fonts in PDF files omit the FontBBox if it is [0 0 0 0].
This should only be a minor optimization, but SourceForge bug #428595 claims
that Acrobat Reader cares. (gdevpsf2.c [1.13]: 2001/07/06 05:17:31 lpd)

Changed debugging flag variables to const. (gshtscr.c [1.6],
gsmdebug.h [1.3], gxchar.c [1.5], gxclimag.c [1.3], gxclip.c [1.4]:
2001/08/01 16:21:34 stefan911)

Changed fill patterns for unallocated memory to const (gsmemory.c [1.3]:
2001/08/02 00:12:08 stefan911)

These changes were originally put into the GS_6_5 branch on 2001/03/13. They
are needed for using the current version of teh graphics library with the
PCL6 code. Short description of changes: stat_.h: Added definition of
stat_is_dir for use with MSVC. Not used in Ghostscript. gsptype1.c: Changes
in image_PaintProc. This routine is used in gs_makepixmappattern.
gs_makepixmappattern is only used in test8 (in gslib.c - a test module) and
gs_makebitmappattern_xform. gs_makebitmappatern_xform is not used in
Ghostscript. It is used in pcl6. (gsptype1.c [1.3]: 2001/08/07 22:13:29
dancoby)

Improves documentation for gs_string and gs_bytestring types; adds
gs_free_[const_]bytestring procedures. (gsmemory.c [1.4], gsmemory.h [1.3],
gstypes.h [1.3]: 2001/08/25 06:46:21 lpd)

Speed up reading stdin when using callouts. Add platform-specific functions
for reading stdin, to allow non-blocking reading of stdin if supported.
Fixes Sourceforge bug #416973. (gp.h [1.7], unistd_.h [1.3]: 2001/09/15
08:48:33 ghostgum)

Improves poor performance of shadings in some cases, notably Coons01.ps.
Long, thin triangles are now cut in half, rather than into four smaller
triangles. Thus, the mesh is more regular. (gxshade4.c [1.5]: 2001/09/22
16:15:43 raph)
