<h3><a name="8.12_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>

<p>Type 1 font hints are no longer applied to charpaths. This is generally an improvement,
but will generate a different outline from previously.

<p>A new virtual functions <tt>can_handle_hl_color()</tt> is required for high-level 
devices derived from <tt>gx_device_vector</tt>.

<p>The library client api now propagates <tt>device_close</tt> errors to the return

<blockquote>
<pre>
In the autoconf build, add the general cflags generated by the configure script to the definition
the the definition of CCAUX. This works around a problem building on cygwin.

DETAILS:

Older versions of cygwin do not provide stdint.h but do define some of the types in sys/types.h.
More recent versions do provide the header but also define them by inclusion in sys/types.h. This
caused a problem with the 'fixup' code we added in response to bug 687162 which defined the
missing half of the types if stdint.h was not detected by the configure script. In versions of
cygwin that do provide stdint.h, most files compile as expected, but genconf.c is compiled with
the alternate CCAUX compiler definition and was not receiving the -DHAVE_STDINT_H argument from
configure, causing a type conflict between the complete set of stdint types pulled in by
sys/types.h and the platform-specific fixup set included when stdint.h is supposedly not
available. Adding the GCFLAGS line to the definition of CCAUX works around the problem and has
little potential to confuse the build in the future.

A similar change made to unix-gcc.mak would need to document the -DHAVE_STDINT_H option for
cygwin. I felt this was unecessarily excessive; we already recommend the autoconf build on systems
that can support it.

Besides that, it prevents a fixed overflow when FontBBox is zero and glyph coordinates are big.
Bug 687175 "(type 1 hinter) A fixed overflow can happen".

This patch removes import_shift and the dependence on FontBBox.
Instead that it dynamically reduces the number of fraction bits

Generailze the trapezoid fillling algorithm for curves, step 1.
The new code is disabled with CURVED_TRAPEZIOD_FILL 0 in gx.h .

DETAILS :

This patch slightly changes the enabled code
with adding more arguments to process_h_lists and end_x_line,
and with renaming gx_flatten_sample and gx_path_is_monotonic.
The new arguments are not used with CURVED_TRAPEZIOD_FILL 0.

With CURVED_TRAPEZIOD_FILL 1 the trapezoid filling algorithm
doesn't need to faltten the path in advance, and should work faster
due to smaller number of segment allocations.
Instead the generating of flattened segments and storing them to RAM
it breaks curves into pieces on-fly with help of
the gx_flattened_curve_iterator. Meanwhile it needs "small" curves.
To provide that we generalized gx_path_is_monotonic to gx_path__check_curves,
and gx_path_add_monotonized to gx_path_copy_reducing(..., pco_small_curves).

Minor changes :
- Fixed the vd_curve macro;
- improved vdtrace calls in gxpflat.c;

Fix for 687020 and 687146.  The pdfwrite device is incorrectly converting
CalRGB color spaces into ICC color spaces.  Fix #1.

Details:

As Raph pointed out in the Wednesday's support call, there are actually
two problems.

1.  We were not correctly recognizing that we can use a CalRGB color space
for the output.  This patch corrects this problem.  One of the tests in
that process was assuming an incorrect ordering to the transforms.  This
fix corrects this problem.

2.  The ICC color space which is being created is not equivalent to the
original CalRGB color space.  This results in differing colors between
the original file and the output PDF file.  This problem is still open.

Note:  I am leaving these bug reports still open since problem 2 is still
open.

Factoring out the iterator for flattened curve segments.

DETAILS :

The new code is marked with FLATTENED_CURVE_ITERATOR defined in gzpath.h.

The old code has bugs in the MERGE_COLLINEAR_SEGMENTS section.

DETAILS :

The old code wrote UCR (undercolor removal) functions with mapping 0 to 0.00392,
causing a solid black to convert to a non-solid color with pkmraw device.
The fix reduces the sample range to [0:254] and generates an appropriate Decode array.

Bug 687109 "PDF-->pkmraw: 0 0 0 RG isn't solid:.
Bug 687138 "pdfwrite is adding poor UCR functions to output files".

EXPECTED DIFFERENCES :

This patch causes multiple differences with pdfwrite->pkmraw.
The change to pdfwrite definitely is a progression,
but it discovers a new bug 687146 "(pdfwrite) CalRGB wrongly converts to ICCBased".

We did not check which differences are coused by the new bug.
Will see after the bug is fixed.
Updating the baseline should be fine for entire list.

Fix: Adobe Acrobat Reader ignores an empty path when setting the clip
path. Bug #687136.

DETAILS:

We never encountered this problem in a 'real' file, but one of Raph's
test files showed the difference in the way our PDF interpreter handled
an zero area path to setting clipping versus the way Adobe does.

Igor tested CPSI and determined that PostScript results in a zero area
clipping box, but Acrobat Reader works differently, so the patch detects
a zero area path and does not change the clipping path in that case.

The details of the determination of 0 area is commented here:

pathbbox	% get the path bounding box
3 -1 roll	% roll to get upper and lower Y coordinates together
sub abs		% form absolute delta Y of path bbox
3 1 roll	% roll upper and lower X coordinates to TOS
sub abs		% form absolute delta X of path bbox
add		% sum abs delta X and abs delta Y
0 ne		% if it is non-zero, then perform the clip/eoclip

Fix (pdfwrite) : Write high level clipping paths.

DETAILS :

This includes the "Preliminary patch for preserving clip path lists-bug686885" by Raph
(gxcpath.c, gzcpath.h), and a simple algorithm for writing it to PDF (gdevpdfd.c).

Now it writes entire list whenever clipping path is changed.
A diserable optimization is to avoid writing redundant elements.
For doing that we would like to have an id and a 'changed' flag in gx_path_s.

Fix : ..includecolorspace caused an abnormal recursion.

DETAILS :

1. With -dNOSUBSTDEVICECOLORS the procedure ..includecolorspace called
setcolorspace, which recursively called ..includecolorspace .
This recursion would be infinit unless an ocasional error
in a stopped context terminates it. We replace setcolorspace
with _setcolorspace_nosub to avoid the recursion.
This fixes the bug 687134 "-dNOSUBSTDEVICECOLORS causes text to disappear".

2. An optimization done with a new dictionary ..page_default_spaces,
which now keeps up to 3 global flags for Default* color spaces,
to reflect whether they were included into a current page.
It prevents redundant calls to _setcolorspace_nosub, .includecolorspace
from ..includecolorspace .

3. Moved .PurgeDict to gs_init.ps because now it is called from showpage, copypage .

4. Added a name argument to .includecolorspace and passed it through
a set of functions in the graphics library and pdfwrite.
Before that Default* color spaces were included into the PDF output
with wrong resource names.

5. Minor change : fixed a procedure header comment in gs_devcs.ps .

EXPECTED DIFFERENCES :

None, because the nightly regression doesn't test -dNOSUBSTDEVICECOLORS .

Fix for 686796 tiffg4 device and incorrect halftone frequency.
This eliminates a problem with not choosing the best halftone cell size
when more than one possible cell size has the exact angle requested.

DETAILS:

Previously the logic for determing the size of the halftone cells used
the product of the error in frequency times the error in the angle as
the metric for determing the best cell size.  For many common angles,
0, 45, 90, etc., this results in an angle error of zero.  This then
gave a value of zero for the metric no matter what the frequency error.
The result was that in many cases we ignored cell sizes that gave a
better frequency match.  The fix revies the metric to choose a cell
size which is closest (geometrically) to the ideal cell size.

Fix (font resource machinery) : Provide correct font names for graphics library.

DETAILS :

The old code passed names of substitutes rather than font names referred by a document.
This patch fixes that with adding a special ney entry /.Alias to the font dictionary.

Besides that, multiple problems are fixed in gs_fonts.ps,
some of them appeared before the repository was created.
Lising them here :

1. Several comments about stack layout in procedure headers were wrong
   since the repository was created.
   We repaired some of them, but possibly not all.

2. The old code assumed that SubstituteFont adds
   a name to the stack rather than replaces it.
   See comment inserted into .dofindfont .
   The patch for the bug 637424 (Revision 1.24, Nov 21, 2002) broken the
   old behavior and left multiple rudiments in code.
   Now we restore the old functionality, and make SubstututeFont
   to be compartible with CPSI, which replaces a name.

3. Now we define fonts for all aliases in the aliasing/substituting chain.
   Not sure it is better than defining only the final one,
   but the pre-repository code did so, and was
   unintentionaly broken by multiple patches.

4. .stdsubstfont dropped some aliases with no strong reason.
   Restoring the old behavior.

5. .tryloadfont damaged the stack balance. It was not visible due to (4).

6. We use a hack to provide the main functionality.
   See comment in .aliasfont . A complete solution is too hard.

7. Inserted auxiliary comments about the stack layout.

This change fixes the bugs
687047 "fonts renamed in resulting pdf file"
687111 "Quality of output wth gs8.11 for pdfwrite device is faded as compared to gs6.12"

EXPECTED DIFFERENCES :

MANY OF pdfwrite TESTS RENDER DIFFERENTLY due to the font substitution had changed.
Now pdfwrite does not embed /NimbusMonL-Regu, but recognize its alias Courier
as a standard font name.

Fix (garbager) : The back pointer validity constraint was wrong.

DETAILS :

Bug 687021 "A crash in memory manager"

Here is what happens :

A big chunk is allocated by i_alloc_struct_array.
Later a part of the array is released.
Then another object is allocated in the released area.
Then the object is being relocated.
The old validity constraint in igc_reloc_struct_ptr assumed that the object
is in a chunk of the standard size.
However it is not.
The check fails, and gs_exit() is called.
The latter calls vm_reclaim and falls into an infinite recursion and crashes.

This patch enhances the constraint for instandard (big) chunks.
Unfortunately their sizes can't easy obtain from igc_reloc_struct_ptr,
therefore the new check only works for pointers to same chunk.
A new field (DEBUG=1 only) is inserted into gc_state_s to access the chunk from
igc_reloc_struct_ptr. We're not happy of this solution,
but there is no idea how to improve it.

EXPECTED DIFFERENCES :

With -Z? the old code failed with pdfwrite->ppmraw with the following tests :

Fix (PDF interpreter) : Shared CID font descriptors did not work properly.

DETAILS :

When a CID font descriptor is shared with several CID font resources,
must create several font objects with different CIDToGIDMap, DW, DW2
taken from CID font resource dictionaries.
The old code created a single font object with one randomly chosen CIDToGIDMap,
making some glyphs inaccessible, and glyphs could misplace.

New procedures adjustCIDType0, adjustCIDType2 are added into the adjustfont
dictionary, so that now CID fonts are processed in same way as fonts.
Bug 687048 "fonts not rendered correctly".

Besides that, the old code on pdf_font.ps created a CDevProc
for processing DW[2], but it was not properly added to the font dictionary and
was not executed. The new code fixes that.
This issue causes rendering differences.

A followup form Leon Bottou :

[beg quote]
I found several pdf files with damaged or incorrect annotations (outlines, links)

When using the pdf interpreter with -dDOPDFMARKS, such
errors cause an execution error in the pdf interpreter

Fix : Disable the grid fitting while charproc accumulation (continued).

DETAILS :

1. If a charproc of a Type 3 font uses another Type 3 font, and the latter
converts to raster, the grid fitting was erroneusly disabled while
its charproc accumulation. Not sure that this case can happen,
but we like to clean up.

2. An optimization to process_plain_text is algorithmically equivalent.
   It is not related to charprocs though.

Fix : Disable the grid fitting while charproc accumulation.

DETAILS :

This is a partial (minor) fix for the bug 687087 "pdfwrite : A mangled /trademark glyph".
The glyph looks fine but still converts to outline.

This change works for pdfwrite only.
It changes several files in the graphics library, but other devices
should percept this change as algorithmically equivalent.

The core of the change is explained in the comment inserted into gdevpdtt.c :

    if (pdev->font3 != 0) {
	/* A text operation happens while accumulating a charproc.
	   This is a case when source document uses a Type 3 font,
	   which's charproc uses another font.
	   Since the text operation is handled by the device,
	   the font isn't converting to a raster (i.e. to a bitmap font).
	   Disable the grid fitting for the convertion to get a proper outlines,
	   because the viewer resolution is not known during the accumulation.
	   Note we set identity CTM in pdf_text_set_cache for the accumilation,
	   and therefore the font may look too small while the source charproc
	   interpretation. The document tpc2.ps of the bug 687087 is an example.
	*/
	penum->device_disabled_grid_fitting = true;
    }

It is implemented with defining the new field device_disabled_grid_fitting
into gs_text_enum_common.

Minor changes :

1. In gs_type1_state_s renamed charpath_flag to no_grid_fitting.
   We believe the new name reflects the semantics better.
   Several function prototypes changed the argument name.

2. decompose_matrix in gxttfb.c changed the prototype,
   and disables the TT grid fitting for very small fonts.
   (We consider it as a minor change, because currently this portion
   is disabled with NEW_TT_INTERPRETER 0 in gx.h).

3. A problem discovered in t1_hinter__set_mapping that
   impedes implementing a grid-fitting disabling for small Type 1,2,11 fonts.
   A comment is inserted into gxhintn.c about that.
   Very samll glyphs can be mangled diring a rasterization, but the mangling
   isn't visible in raster with such small sizes.
   Therefore the problem isn't important.

EXPECTED DIFFERENCES :

None with comparefiles.

The test file tpc2.ps of the bug 687073 doesn't cause a mangled glyph,
rather the glyph still converts to outline.

Return correct /DeviceGray color space from currentcolorspace operator
inside PaintProc of the uncolored pattern and cache device (bug 627169).
Use igs->color_space to track the current color space.
Fix bug 687080 from customer 710.

DETAILS:

The problem in bug 687080 is definitely a conflict about the current
color space while the PaintProc is being executed.  There are two
color space indicators: pgs->color_space and igs->colorspace.  Most
of the time these two agree and there is no problem.  However during
pattern accumulation pgs->color_space has been temporarily changed
from a pattern color space to DeviceGray.  This causes a problem
when the currentcmyk operator is called.  Currently, before this fix,
it calls currentcolor which returns a DeviceGray color.  Then a
color to CMYK routine is called based upon the color space being
a pattern color space.  This then fails since it has the wrong input
color values.

The fix looks at the current color space, in pgs->color_space,
and is special casing DeviceGray.  The fix should work better than
the current logic.  The only problem area would likely be if we have
other 'temporary' color spaces besides DeviceGray.  I do not know of
any and the current logic would also fail.

Fix: Pattern color spaces that used save/restore within the PaintProc
would result in infinite looping with high level devices such as the
pdfwrite device since the restore cleared the pattern cache so that
after the restore, the pattern PaintProc would need to be executed
again. Bug #687052 for customer #411.

DETAILS:

The 'is_dummy' flag in the pattern cache indicates that the cache
entry does not contain bitmap or tile bits, but rather is just
a placeholder for the pattern 'id'.

The patch does not delete entries for pattern color spaces that
have is_dummy != 0. The pdfwrite device creates all pattern cache
entries as dummies.

This change does not result in any regression and, of course, prevents
the infinite looping.

Fix (PDF interpreter) : Adjust the currentpoint saved back into TextMatrix so that it
does not include the effect of TextRise.

DETAILS :

Bug 686837 "PDF with subscript rendered wrong"
Patch from Raph Levien.

Here is analyzis from Raph Levien :
[beg quote]

the test file is using PDF's Ts operator to adjust the
"text rise", exactly as shown in section 5.2.6 "Text Rise" of the
PDF manual (3rd ed). Ghostscript's rendering is incorrect because
the "settextposition" function (in pdf_ops.ps) updates the TextMatrix
using the current point after showing the text. However, this point
already contains the effect of TextRise. Then, the next time
settextmatrix is invoked, it applies TextMatrix, followed by a
second TextRise.

The patch below simply reverses the effect of TextRise before setting
TextMatrix. I believe that the correct invariant is that
"settextposition" followed by "settextstate" should result in (0, 0)
being the current point in the resulting CTM. I argue that the patch
fulfills the invariant, as follows. Let the current point be (x, y),
relative to TextSaveMatrix. Then, settextposition sets the translate
portion of TextMatrix to (x, y - TextRise). Then, settextmatrix (as
invoked from settextstate) applies TextMatrix followed by TextRise,
for a net translation of (x, y).

Query: is this reasoning still valid for arbitary rotations and scales
in TextMatrix (as set by Tm)? It seems so to me, but I believe testing
is required to establish this definitively.

Implementing a bridge to the True Type bytecode interpreter (step 13).

DETAILS :

The switch NEW_TT_INTERPRETER in gx.h is set to disable the new code.

This patch implements a new user parameter GridFitTT.
A change to documentation isn't supplied because
this code is disabled by NEW_TT_INTERPRETER 0.
Here is definition :

GridFitTT=1 forces the TT interpreter to perform a grid fitting.

If a font initialization program uses patented instrictions,
the font renders without a grid fitting, and a warning is printed to stderr.

If a font initialization program doesn't use patented instrictions,
and some glyphs of the font uses patented instructions,
the glyphs renders without a grid fitting, and a warning is printed to stderr.

If a font initialization program doesn't use patented instrictions,
and a glyph of the font doesn't use patented instructions,
the glyph renders with grid fitting, and no warning is printed.

Note that some font may mix both grid-fitted and non-grid-fitted glyphs.

GridFitTT=0 forces the TT interpreter to skip the grid fitting.
The warning about "patented" font is not printed.

The user parameter can be set by the new command line option -dGridFitTT=x,
where x is 0 or 1.

This is part of the fix for 687055.  This change splits the DeviceN
parameter handling.  The SeparationOrder parameter handling is split

DETAILS:

The DeviceN parameter SeparationOrder is used to select which separations
are to be included in the output.  This parameter is not appropriate for
high level devices like pdfwrite.  The pdfwrite device does not attempt
to separate its output into separations.  However the pdfwrite device
does use its process color model colors for specifying output colors in
some backup cases.  If a separation were missing then the it would create
an incorrect output color. By splitting out the SeparationOrder parameter
we can still use common routines for pdfwrite and other DeviceN output
devices.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Don't use Tj when real width is smaller than 1% of Widths.

DETAILS :

This is a workaround for the bug 687051
"freehand patterns cause incorrect result".
See comment in code.

Our workaround is hewristical.
To get a strongly guaranteed result a bug to be reported to Freehand,
which sets a wrong character size with setcachedevice :
the setcachedevice arguments appear 144 times bigger when the actual glyph size.
After converting to PDF it causes too big numeric errors in a PDF viewer.

Adobe Distiller converts this text into a paintings of
individual glyphs, loosing the text features, and enlarging the uncompressed output.
The Adobe's method appears acceptable with this document
because the text actually represents a texture, and the text features (Encoding, etc.)
appears unimportant. We can't implement the Adobe's method because we have no idea
how to recognize in pdfwrite the case of a Type 3 font represents a texture.

Users may want to apply an idiom recognition in PS level for that texture,
to convert it into a regular images for a better coordinate precision.
The ideom approach is independent to this patch, and we believe that
both things can work togeter.

"freehand patterns cause incorrect result".
It wrote an excessive clipping path at the end of charproc.

This patch doesn't close the bug, because there is another problem
(with Type 3 character placement) in there.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Inline images mangled charproc stream.

DETAILS :

The problem discovered with the test document of the bug 687051

The problem happened due to pdf_copy_data can't handle the case

Don't apply Type 1 hinting to charpath.
THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE : charpath now creates a different outline than before.

DETAILS :

Adobe doesn't hint charpath.
Not sure why GS did.
This change makes GS to be closer to Adobe and
partially fixes the bug 687044 "strange elements with text".

Note that 'charpath fill' never was equal to 'show'. Neither the old hinter,
nor the new hinter, nor any combination of them in the pair ('charpath', 'show')
give same result. This happens because 'fill' uses the "center pixel inside" rule,
but 'show' uses a different one. With the new hinter 'show' performs
a spot topology analyzis during the rasterization. This rule doesn't belong
to the class of rules, which can be explained in terms "a part of pixel inside".

Thus, since "same" or "closer" result isn't possible,
the criterion for the choice must lie in another space.
I believe that the "Adobe compatibility" is the right one.

Besides that, Ghostscript PDF imperpreter emulates the text rendering modes 1,5,6
with 'charpath stroke', and with the hinted charpath the results look strange.

Provide a means for disabling color space substitution.

DETAILS:

Ghostscript supports substituting CIE and ICC color spaces for DeviceGray
DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK color spaces.  This is part of the support for
the UseCIEColor feature in PostScript.  This substitution is done inside
the PostScript code in lib/gs_devcs.ps.

The recent improvements to the pdfwrite device mean that the interpreter's
color space and color values are now passed to the output file.  Since
the color space substitution is done prior to passing the color space to
the interpreter, the original color space is lost if UseCIEColor is
set.  This change provides a means to prevent the substitution.  Thus
the original color space is passed to the interpreter and on to the
output file for pdfwrite.

DETAILS :

It defines a new gs_text_process return value TEXT_PROCESS_CDEVPROC,

we apply zchar_set_cache to prepare interpreter stacks,
and hook its results in pte->procs->set_cache .

The "fixme" comment is removed because it appears wrong.
If the color space is new, it needs a complete serialization
for storing the data to PDF resource. We can't delay the serialization
because the life time of the original color space may exceed before
the next comparizon happens. Contrary, if the color space is not new,
it also needs a complete serialization for a full comparison,
to know whether it is same color space.
Thus, a complete serialization is required in any case.

Rename the client header errors.h to ierrors.h. This is more consistent
with iapi.h, and reduces the risk of a namespace conflict. The old
errors.h header is still available, and simply includes ierrors.h
for compatibility. This file is marked as deprecated and will be removed
in a future release.

This change is in response to a spurious report of a namespace conflict on MacOS in bug 686966.

This patch encloses rudiments of the old hinter with "#ifdef KEEP_OLD_HINTER",

This change is algorithmically equivalent,
because the new hinter worked instead the old one. Only exception is
the change to gstype1.c ln 370 : the condition t1_hinter__is_x_fitting(h)
is waeker than the old pcis->fh.use_x_hints, because
the new hinter applies an X-grid fitting with a slightly sloped transforms.

The change to gdevpsfx.c define local arrays for storing hints.

Fix for 686948 Dotted lines messing in PDF.  Draw all line cap
types for zero line lengths.  Previously only rounded caps were
drawn.

DETAILS:

This is a (minor) revision to a the previous fix from Jeong for
this problem.

For those people who do not remember, this problem involves a dashed
line with a zero line length for the imaged (pen down) part of the
dashed line.  Ghostscript currently calls this a degenerate situation
and does nothing except for round line caps.  Jeong had previously
proposed changing the test to any line cap except butt caps.  Jeong
removed this proposal after testing and finding that Adobe Acrobat
drew thin line segments even for butt line caps.

This proposal simply removes the test for line cap type completely.
It does still leaves a test for dot length = 0.

The routine already contains code for using adjacent line segments
to determine a 'direction' for zero length segments.

Testing with both butt and square line caps and with on axis and
diagonal lines produces results comparable to Adobe Acrobat.
(Acrobat is not consistent with segment widths for the butt joints.)

pdfwrite : Implementing a high level color handling.

DETAILS :

pdfwrite now passes colors identically except minor problems,
which should be fixed soon :

1. rectfill still converts colors.
   This happens because gs_rectfill calls dev_proc(pdev,fill_rectangle),
   which doesn't pass device color.
   Therefore high level color is not available for pdfwrite.
   This is an architectural problem which requires a hard decision.

2. Some documents (gs.anotherfailure.pdf is an example) generate
   too many color space objects to the output PDF.
   Requires an optimization.

3. 477-03.ps embeds a color space that can't write to PDF due to PDF limitations.
   Process colors are written into PDF.

4. Few tests cause significant difference in colors :
	0.pdf               (yellow background)
	MagicEye.pdf        (yellow background)
	Fixed_Original.pdf
	Testform.v1.0.2.pdf (a gray rectangle disappears)
   To be analyzed.

A preparation for high level color handling in vector devices.

THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE for devices derived from gx_device_vector.
Now they must implement the new virtual function can_handle_hl_color.
A simplest impementation compatible to the old behavior is to return false.

DETAILS :

The new code uses the new functions gx_hld_save_color and
gx_hld_saved_color_equal instead the old gx_saved_color_update.
This allows devices to know when the client color changes and
to generate the appropriate output. This affects
pdfwrite, pswrite, epswrite, pxlmono and pxlcolor devices.
However the devices still write device colors to output.
An implementation of writing the client color
in pdfwrite, pswrite, epswrite will be the next improvement.

Since a big part of color code is shared with pxlmono and pxlcolor,
we need a switch for checking whether the device can handle
high level colors. For this purpose we add a new
virtual function can_handle_hl_color to gx_device_vector_procs.
Currently all implementation of this function return false,
and all devices still write process colors.

A minor change : psdf_setfillcolor and psdf_setstrokecolor
are removed because they were never called.

the install-exec target, parallel to the existing std target, which
is the default chosen from a simple "make" invocation.

<h2><a name="Version8.11"></a>Version 8.11 (2003-08-16)</h2>

<p>
Ghostscript 8.11 is the first stable release since 8.00,
building on the features in the 8.10 beta, and with numerous 
additional fixes and improvements.
In particular, font rendering is greatly improved (thanks to Igor
Melichev's new hinting code), PDF 1.4 transparency rendering is much
more likely to be correct, and there is better support for CID font
substitution. Processing of incorrect and broken PDF files is also
improved, including files corrupted xref tables and non-ASCII font
names. Many other smaller fixes are included.
<p>
Users may want to experiment with the new -dAlignToPixels=0 setting,
which enables subpixel positioning for antialiased font rendering.

<pre>
Cleans up the behavior of the .tempfile operator, primarily making it
consistent across all the platforms, ensuring that the TMPDIR and TEMP
environment variables are effective, the system temp directory is used
when these are not specified, and the permissions for tempfile
creation work as expected (allowed in the simple case, but closing off
potential vulnerabilities in other cases. Intended as a final fix for
bug #686922.

DETAILS:

1. The permissions behavior of .tempfile is changed so that simple
prefixes are always allowed, absolute pathname prefixes are checked
using the PermitFileWriting logic, and other cases are disallowed. In
particular, it is no longer possible to specify temp prefixes relative
to the current directory, or as subdirectories of the standard temp
directory. Both such cases are potential security holes, and are
probably not useful in any real application.

2. The meaning of gp_open_scratch_file() is made more consistent
across the platforms. In particular, it is now the clear
responsibility of this function to add the appropriate temp
directory. As such, gp_gettmpdir() is no longer exported in the public
gp.h interface (gpmisc.h is intended only for the convenience of gp_
implementations).

3. On VMS, gp_open_scratch_file() didn't previously add the
temporary directory pathname. Now it does.

4. On Windows, gp_open_scratch_file()'s behavior was somewhat
inconsistent, calling GetTempPath() only when the length of the TMPDIR
or TEMP environment variables overflowed the buffer provided. It
now additionally uses GetTempPath() in the cases where these
environment variables are not set.

5. Since gp_open_scratch_file() now takes responsibility for
determining the temporary directory, ztempfile() no longer attempts
to do this.

Convert ASCII range font names found during the FONTPATH scanning to
simole ASCII aliases (original Unicode names preserved). Fixes bug 686861
for customer 131.

DETAILS:

This is an interim patch that establishes the alias in the ASCII code
range if (and only if) the high byte of ALL characters in the name are
NULL (\000).

The future improved implementation would be to add a UTF-8 fontname when
the TTF font has the name in Unicode. This would allow simple PostScript
applications that use the 8-bit character name to work as this patch does.

Pass path across grestore using base "identity" coordinates to prevent
limitcheck errors. The upath operator returns coordinates in the current
user space, but these are no longer valid across a CTM change such as
"grestore" or "setgstate" causes. Fixes SF bug #687001 for customers
580 and 590.

DETAILS:
The patch gets the upath using identity user space, then stuffs it into
the graphics state after the grestore in the same identity space
restoring the CTM of the grestore after the uappend.

Both grestore_nopath and setgstate are modified. These could probably
be refactored later to share PS code, but the value is minimal (IMO).

Interesting that this hadn't turned up before, but two customers tripped
over this recently.

Fixes two pointers to freed objects that were left dangling
in the PDF 1.4 transparency logic. Fixes bug #686994.

DETAILS:

With some test files, saved graphics states had held on to pointers to
the device filter stack that had already been freed by a
gs_pop_device_filter() call. These dangling pointers can cause garbage
collection corruption. This patch introduces reference counting
discipline to these pointers so that the dfilter_stack objects are not
actually freed until the last reference is dropped.

A similar but simpler argument applies to the pdf14_ctx object in the
pdf14_device. This patch simply sets the pointer to NULL when freeing
the context.

Fix for Bug 686991  Memory leak in CET test file 12-07.ps.

DETAILS:

A pointer to a free object was found while running the CET with the
memory allocation test switches (-Z@?$).  The free object was a color
space and the pointer was inside a gs_image_enum_common structure.

The situation occurs when an error is found in the data source for
for an image.   The actual cause was that the image enum common
structure should have also been released.

Note:  The data source checking is the only place that has this
problem.  After the data source checking, the image enum common
structure pointer is placed into an image enum structure.  Errors
that are detected after that point call gx_image_cleanup which
handles all of the data in the image enum structure including the
image enum common structure.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Widths were computed wrongly with Type 3 fonts.

DETAILS :

1. With glyphshow process_text_modify_width called pdf_char_widths with GS_NO_CHAR.

2. In pdf_char_widths an index for real_widths array was wrong (2 times smaller) with Type 3.

3. Now we write Widths as reals, improving the precision.
   Now the precision isn't smaller than 1/100, rather the old code
   looses all significant digits when a width is smaller than 1.
   A better way would be re-scaling the font, but currently we don't see a strong need for that.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Providing an access to the original font matrix via a special

DETAILS :

The new key is implementation specific and should not affect regular documents.
It works for the case when a font is copied like this :

	/x findfont dup length dict copy
	/y exch definefont

- it points from the copy to the original font.

This change fixes Ghostscript Bug 686970 "Overlapping characters"
and causes a progression with 455690.pdf with pdfwrite.

A long ago Peter L. Deutsch and me discussed the heuristic in
pdf_font_orig_matrix/font_orig_scale. I was aware of its limitations,
but I followed Peter's authority. Now we get a real case that it can't handle,
and therefore I take the responsibility for the different approach.

Add an initial outermost save unless -dNOOUTERSAVE option is specified.
Fixes Bug #686972 and others that were closed with the instructions to
use -c "save pop" prior to the file.

DETAILS:
The initial save is needed for several ProcSets from Adobe applications
and those of other vendors that expect objects in global VM to be retained
after a restore that would otherwise remove objects in global VM defined
after the corresponding save.

This kept recurring because several ProcSets from Adobe, Quark and others
expect to run under a job server. The -dNOOUTERSAVE is needed for backward
compatibility and for those that want to run under a job server and want
global VM to be restored between jobs (as expected under a job server).

Note that the save object is discarded so that it cannot be used to restore
to the state prior to .setsafe and thus circumvent security when -dNOSAFER
is used and .setsafe or .locksafe is subsequently used to go to SAFE mode.

Improve native font enumeration on MacOS. This feature is still not enabled.

DETAILS:

There are six different api calls to open a resource file on MacOS Carbon,
all of various provenance and history. We were using FSOpenResourceFile()
in our FOND parsing code because it will open the data fork of .dfont files
or the resource fork of resource font files. Very convenient. However, it
fails for some common font files with broken resource maps. Therefore we
now fall back to FSpOpenResFile() which only tries the resource fork, but
can handle the broken maps, if the first attempt fails. I've not encountered
any .dfont files with broken resource maps; they're a recent phenomenon so
we should be safe there.

Also contains changes to skip the FOND parsing for .ttf and .otf filenames,
to ask for 'Local' instead of 'Global' fonts in the enumerator (the difference
is unclear) and changes to use the Carbon headers in the Carbon build.

Read a PostScript embedded ICC input profile into a bytestring (.bigstring)

DETAILS:

Since we don't know the size of the bytestring needed to invoke .bigstring,
we read the ICC profile data into an array of 64,000 byte strings, then
create the bytestring and fill it with putinterval.

This bytestring then becomes the source for a ReusableStreamDecode filter
which is a seekable filter. We'd like to have simply used SubFileDecode
filter and ASCIIHexDecode as the source for ReusableStreamDecode, but
this only works if SubFileDecode has a count.

pdfwrite : Improving the font metrics handling.

DETAILS :

1. Metrics, Metrics2 was ignored for CID fonts;
2. usematrix was ignored;
3. v-vector was erroneusely scaled down in 1000 for TT fonts;
4. glyph_info mixed WMode 0 1nd 1 in some cases.

This patch is a partial fix for the bug #686947 "rotated japanese chars".
A complete fix should include a handling of CDevProc.

This patch causes an unexpected progression of pdfwrite with keyboard.pdf
at any resolution, and a minor difference with 093-01.ps at 300dpi.

we need to provide a bigger CIDCount since we don't

<pre>
Initial check in of the native font enumeration mechanism with an implementation for MacOS. The
code is currently disabled pending resolution of bugs regarding some font files.

DETAILS:

This adds a trio of gp_enumerate_fonts calls which implement an interator for querying the native
operating system for font files. This is essentially required to make use of the support for
reading resource-based font collection files on MacOS since there is no convenient way to
construct a Fontmap by hand. Thus our initial implementation focusses there and only stubs are
provided on other platforms. However, it would generally be a useful feature on any system that
provides such services.

An iterator object is created with gp_enumerate_fonts_init() and released with
gp_enumerate_fonts_free(). Between these calls, each font is returned by a successive
call to gp_enumerate_fonts_next() as a pair of C strings giving the access path and reported font
name.

On MacOS these are implemented using the FMFontIterator API from Carbon. Unfortunately, while this
returns font names and files, it does not provide details about the resource internals so we must
open the file and extract the resource id corresponding to the font itself. It also is not always
possible to obtain the correct postscript name from the OS call.

Connection is made to postscript through the .getnativefonts operator, implemented in zfontenum.c.
I handles the interation and places the results on the stack as an array of two element arrays,
each representing the name and path as postscript strings. New code in gs_fonts.ps calls this and
adds the entries to the fontmap after first calling .findfontname on each path to verify
accessibility and in case the reported font name is unreliable. This is implemented as the
.buildnativefontmap procedure, which is called by the font location logic if a requested font
is not found in the Fontmap.

Caveats: This can be a very expensive operation, so like the FONTPATH directory scanning it should
probably only happen once in a given session, instead of every time a font isn't found. The macos
implementation could also be considerably streamlined.

Remove <limit.h> inclusions as it defines types that conflict with our
std*.h on HPUX and probably other systems. Fix for bug 686920.

Also correct the copyright dates for gxhintn.c.

DETAILS:

limits.h was defining ushort on HPUX which conflicts with the definition
imported in stdpre.h. There are two approaches within our portability
framework: don't use these defines, or make them part of the
output from genarch. Since there's only one use in the code (for
MIN_LONG) I simply defined it at the top of the file.

The test used should work on all 2's complement systems and would
probably fail miserably on anything else. It was the most portable
define I could come up with. A less assuming variant
((long)(ARCH_MAX_ULONG>>1)+1) also works but generates a warning about
the overflow.

genarch.c could of course test a variety of candidates and look for the
rollover. We could also switch to autoconf for provisioning the whole
set of defines. This was chosen as the simplest fix for the time.

This patch improves the text rendering mode 3 only.
Other text modes stay like they were -
implemented with charpath in pdf_ops.ps
(to be improved someday).

We process invisible text with TEXT_DO_NONE,
adding an additional check to op_show_restore in zchar.c .
We would like to implement a new mode TEXT_DO_INVISIBLE,
but we don't want to do so deep change without a strong neccessity.
It can be subject of a further improvement.

With this patch stringwidth won't work with text rendering mode 3.
We never use this combination.
TEXT_DO_INVISIBLE could work for it.

Permit explicit specification of /GDBytes equal to 0 for incrementally
downloadable CIDFonts.
Fixes bug 686890 from customer 131.

DETAILS:
Incrementally downloadable CIDFont has GlyphDirectory key. According to
PLRM3 p. 376 "The binary data section of a CIDFont with a GlyphDirectory entry
does not need a charstring offset table or charstrings; if present, they will
be ignored". PLRM3 says nothing about GDBytes entry but it seems logical that
the entry is no longer needed when the structure it describes is ignored.

Old code used 0 as a default GDBytes value but required explicit specification
to be > 0. New code permits explicit 0 value because "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for
Word" generates it.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Convert Type 0 fonts with multiple CID font descendents into
Type 0 fonts with single CID font descendents (the part 3).

DETAILS :

At last we got a non-degenerate test for multiple CID font descendents
and could debug this stuff with a real document.

This patch mixes several changes :

- In some cases CIDFontType 2 fonts wrongly computed glyph indices ignoring GlyphDirectory.
  The new function z11_glyph_info works for it.

- The text decomposition in gdevpdtc.c mixed font indices of various font descendents.

- font->procs.get_glyph_info sometimes received glyph indices
  instead glyph names or CIDs. This happened with subglyphs of a CIDFontType 2 glyph.
  This patch improves the semantics of gs_glyph with distinguishing
  CIDs and GIDs with a new tag in the 2nd high order bit.
  The new macro GS_MAX_GLYPH_INDEX and related stuff
  works for it.

- gdevpdtd.c tried to compute CID font features using glyph names,
  which don't exist in this case. Replaced with CIDs.

- In gdevtrac.c a wrong glyph space was specified enumerating glyphs
  (a minor change, since gdevtrac.c is almost an example).

- Fixed a compiler warning in gdevdevn.c .

Working on this patch, we can see rudiments
in pdfwrite code, which are inherited from pre-8.00 code
(before stable font copies are implemented), which to be fixed someday :

- subset_glyphs arguments in gdevpsft.c looks always NULL
  and probably to be removed;

- COPY_GLYPH_BY_INDEX is now obsolete and to be removed;

- glyph enumeration procedures (*enumerate_glyph*) sometimes retrieve
  a wrong tag in gs_glyph values. The new macro GS_GLYPH_TAG works against it,
  rather an improvement to enumeration procedures would be useful.

The patch is debugged with korea.ps from the bug #686894.
After this change the embedded composite font with 2 CIDFontType 2
descendents is correctly decomposed into 2 Type 0 fonts with
single descendents (the old (gs8.10) code converts it into a Type 3
with outlines). The generated PDF satisfies the PDF specification
and Ghostscript can handle it. Meanwhile Acrobat Reader 4,5,6
fails with it. It appears an old known problem :
if a Type 42 font and a CIDFontType 2 with a non-standard CMap
appear in same PDF document, Acrobat Reader fails.
We believe it's a bug in Acrobat reader, because if we
modify the document with removing portions of text so that
only one of the 2 fonts is really used, Acrobat Reader renders it fine.
It fails only when both things are really used for rendering.
A workaround for this problem to do separately.

Add a prefix header file for the MacOS Carbon build to enable target-specific settings.

DETAILS:

Metrowerks CodeWarrior doesn't really have an equivalent of the -D commandline option to set CPP
defines at compile time. This makes it difficult to set target-specific #ifdef's, for example the
__CARBON__ switches used in the MacOS support code. The closest thing offered is a hook in the
project file for a 'prefix' header file that will be prepended to each source file as it is fed to
the preprocessor. We add such a file for the carbon build, and enable it in the project file xml.

The conditional in macgenmcpxml.sh is a direct comparison for the Ghostscript carbon shlib name,
which is excessively brittle. Something like perl's =~ /carbon/i on the target name would be
preferable, but I couldn't figure out how to do that reliably in sh.

A pair of fixes for Bug 686791   Device bitcmyk produces wrong output
The bitcmyk device produce the wrong output if GrayValues=8.  In this
case the pixel size is 32 bits.  The encode_color procedure was sign
extending the  MSB into the upper 32 bits of 64 bit gx_color_indexes.
The fix in gdevbit.c prevents this from happening.  The fix in gdevm32.c
makes it so that it does not matter.  I am including both for
completeness.  The bitcmyk device should not produce garbage in the
remaining bits.  Thus the first fix.  However there may be other

Fix (pdfwrite) : Convert Type 0 fonts with multiple CID font descendents into
Type 0 fonts with single CID font descendents.

DETAILS :

Bug 686869 "Rasterized characters".

Our testbase doesn't test this case. Rather the test file for 686869
contains a font with 2 CID descendents, it actually uses only the 1st
descendent, so it's not a complete test.

The new code fails with 401-01.ps . This test file is buggy and
requires a special workaround, which should be a separate patch.

The main change is gdevpdtc.c, gdevpdtf.h .

Minor changes :

- added a new argument to a set of CMap management functions to access a
  submap corresponding to a specified font index;

- gs_cmap_init now reserves so many gs_id numbers,
  as many fonts it refer;

- removed some unused variables (gdevpdfm.c, gdevpdfv.c, gdevpdtb.c).

<h2><a name="Version8.10"></a>Version 8.10 (2003-05-21)</h2>

<p>
The 8.10 release is an incremental release from 8.00. It contains
some fairly substantial reworking of important modules, most notably
in the font rendering. Because of the extent of the changes, we're
labelling this as a beta release. It should be quite usable, but
it hasn't been as thoroughly wrung out as our production releases.
<p>
The major new feature improved font rendering by Igor Melichev. The
new font renderer prevents dropouts intelligently rather than relying
on "fill_adjust" (which has the side effect of making the font
bolder).
<p>
In addition, pdfwrite continues to evolve and improve. Most patterns
and type 3 fonts are now output as high-level objects rather 
than being rasterized.
<p>
This is our first release with support for JBIG2 encoded images, using
our jbig2dec library. This decoder is not yet complete, but
successfully decodes many PDF files containing JBIG2 images.
<p>
This release also contains an important security fix. If you are using
Ghostscript in a security-critical application, we recommend you
upgrade now.
<p>
Finally, we include the usual bug fixes and improvements. Please
exercise this release thoroughly, so we can make the next release
rock-solid.

1.  Ignore data after %%EOF whicl scanning for objects or trailer.
2.  Allow objects with duplicate object and generation numbers.
3.  Change heuristic for finding the trailer dictionary.

DETAILS:

The previous testing had on the rebuild facility had verified that
all test files ran without apparent problems.  However a full check
of the files in the regression test suite has found three cases of
the output images not matching between the normal PDF processing
and the rebuild processing.

1.  Many real life PDF files contain garbage after the final %%EOF
marker.  Ghostscript has known about and tolerated this situation for
some time.  I found a test case (adesso6.pdf) in which the repair
logic was finding what it considered a valid object in this garbage.
The revisions determine the location of the last %%EOF and form a
count of the data left in the file after the %%EOF.  This count is
used to exclude this data from the object scanning and the trailer
location scanning.

2.  A test case was found in which two objects were found to have
the same object number and revision number.  By my reading of the
PDF spec, the newer object should have a higher revision number.
However the object scanner was changed to accept the last such
object as the desired one.  Most PDF editors (at least Adobe) put
updated objects at the end of the file.

3.  A test case was found in which a Linearized PDF file had been
edited and a new xref list and trailer dictionary were placed at
the end of the file.  The heuristic for finding the trailer dictionary
was changed to check the specified location of the 'first' xref list.
If this location is in the first half of the file, then the start of
the file is searched for the first trailer.  Otherwise the end of the
file is searched for the last trailer.

With these three changes, all of the PDF files in the regression
test suite produce matching results using either the normal PDF
processing or the rebuild procedures.

The TrueType font loading was quite a bit slower than it should be. This

DETAILS:

Analysis of the time spent during TT font loading led to two problem areas.

The first was that the cmap array was built inefficiently when their was
a large glyph range, that had large holes was built with a loop that
called a PostScript function 'putglyph' to fill unused areas with .notdef
(glyph ID 0). The revision pre-fills the 'glyphs' array with .notdef from
a static array pre-filled with 1024 zeroes.

The second problem was the code that built the encoding using the 'post'
table. This code had a 'repeat' loop to find the name from the start of
the glyphNames section of the 'post' table for each named glyph in the
encoding. By creating a temporary cross reference, only one pass through
the names is made.

Correct the implementation of the new file_name_combine operators for MacOS.

Details:

The parent directory reference prefix is '::' rather than ':'. Also, a path
that begins with the ':' directory separator is a relative path from the
current working directory.

The more substantive change is in the implementation on gp_check_root(), intended
to return the 'root' prefix of a path, if any. The previous implementation returned
the location of the first patch separator, causing initialization to fail when
attempting to determine if GenericResourceDir ends in a directory separator in
gs_res.c.

Absolute paths are not a well defined concept on Classic MacOS. In that case we just
return 0, as if no path were ever absolute. This likely causes other problems not
addressed here. In the Carbon build, we make use of the FSGetVolumeInfo() call
to enumerate all mounted volumes, attempting to match each one. This call returns a
16-bit char unicode name for each volume which we make no attempt to convert to
whatever 8-bit encoding ghostscript might receive the path in orginally; however
we do match the lower 8 bits for the first 256 characters, which works well enough
for English volume names.

Note that this patch only provides support for MacOS-style paths with ':' as a
separator. The Metrowerks Standard Library also accepts unix-style paths and
on MacOS X users will expect to be able to use them. Support will need to be
extended to include this.

<blockquote><pre>
This is a set of routines for attempting to recover PDF files which
have been mangled by EOL conversions.  This is a facility which Adobe
Acrobat has and thus we need to duplicate.

DETAILS:

THE PROBLEM:

The basic problem is that PDF files contain 'xref tables' which are
really object location indexes which contain the absolute position of
objects in a file.  If a file is changed by converting the type of
EOLs then the file size is changed and the xref data is no longer
valid.  In many cases, Acrobat can rebuild these files.  It is not
always possible to always rebuild files.  If the files contain binary
data which contains line feed or new line characters then the binary
data may be mangled and cannot be rebuilt.  We need to be able to
duplicate Acrobat's ability for rebuilding files.  (Note:  In theory
one can get more and more sophisticated about rebuilding files.  The
techniques used in this code are quite simple but effective.)

THE BASIC SOLUTION:

The solution to this problem consists of several pieces.  The first piece
was to modify the pdf interpreter's internal representation of the xref
data.  The xref data is stored into two larrays.  The larray Generations
contains the object's generation number.  This was not changed.  The
larray Objects contained the location of the xref entry in the file.
This was set initially by the readxref routine.  Since the xref entry
data is not valid (for mangled files) this was not useful.  Objects
was changed to contain the actual location of the object in the file.
This actually eliminates one step in the process.  Previously when an
object was referenced, the location of the xref entry in the file was
obtained from Objects and then the xref entry was read to determine
the actual location of the desired object.

The second part of the process was to put .internal_stopped trapping
around the two usages of readxref to catch any failures of that routine.
An error message is printed and we then try to rebuild the locations
of the objects and find the proper trailer dictionary.

The third part of the process is to locate the objects in the file.
This is done by a simple scan of the file looking for lines beginning
with x y obj where x is a object number and y is object generation
number and obj is the text 'obj'.  In theory this simple strategy can
be confused by binary data but with over 156 files tested, no problems
were found.

The fourth part of the process is to locate the appropriate 'trailer'
dictionary.  There is a trailer dictionary with each xref list.  In
theory there can be many trailer dictionaries in a file.  The only
desired trailer dictionary is the one associated with the 'first'
xref list.  Unfortunately since we cannot count on the location
information in a mangled file, following the xref links is problematic.
The solution used is simple.  For Linearized pdf files, we find the
first (at the front of the file) trailer dictionary otherwise we use
the last trailer dictionary in the file.  This simple method works
for the 151 known good files (see testing below) and all five known
bad files.

Included are diffs for the changes and the new file lib/pdf_rbld.ps.
The only change in the src directory was the addition of pdf_rbld.ps
to the int.mak file.

TESTING:

There have been two sets of test run on this code.  The first set
consists of running 151 pdf files from our regression test suite.
These files are not mangled.  However by disabling the normal readxref
routine, the new code was exercised.  All 151 pdf files were displayed
correctly.

The second set of tests consists of actual problem files.  I was able
to locate five files that we have been sent that have been mangled.

file name		Ghostscript	Acrobat 5.0.5
1003.pdf		   okay		   okay
cm_test.pdf		   okay		   okay
precon.pdf		   okay	  	   fail
ServletReport.pdf	   fail	       	   fail
dauben.pdf		   fail		   fail

As expected, not all files can be recovered.  I was pleased that,
for this small sample, we did better than Acrobat.

error is expected.  However the token operator is leaving 3 items on the
stack.  It should only leave one:  The original string.  This fix
corrects the problem.

DETAILS:

The problem was found while developing the xref data recovery facility
which uses the token operator to scan PDF files (including binary data).
The fix consists of simply recording the operator stack level at the
start of the string processing and restoring it if an error occurs.

The revision to the fix consists of using the 'pop' macro to modify
the o_stack pointer instead of directly setting the pointer.

Fixes bugs 686836 "-r doesn't work" and duplicate 686838
"Ghostscript doesn't do anything".

DETAILS:
The display memory device and the raster including line pointers
was allocated using the stable allocator of the display device.
This had a limit of 1Mbyte, which was exceeded when the
resolution was greater then 114dpi.  This would cause subsequent
allocations to fail, but it appears that nothing else tried to
use this allocator after the display device.  The display device
was changed to allocate the line pointers separately to allow
the raster to be allocated in special memory, e.g. video memory
or shared memory.  This caused the subsequent allocation of the
line pointers to fail when resolution exceeded 114dpi.

The modified code now allocates the raster with
gs_alloc_byte_array_immovable, which allocates directly from the
C heap, not subject to any memory limit apart from the overall
-K limit if specified, and is not subject to garbage collection.
The normal allocator now has sufficient memory to allocate the
line pointers without problem. The raster pointer is removed
from the pointers that are enumerated during garbage collection.

Log Message:

This is the fix for 686798 /typecheck in --setcolorspace-- with
-sDEVICE=x11cmyk. This fix increases the stack checking while sampling
tint transform functions. It also makes the error handling more robust
for invalid tint transforms.

DETAILS:

It is sad to say but this is a bug that we have seen before, several
times.  Ray and I fixed this problem at the last code fest in September.
However that fix did not make its way into CVS.

The cause of this problem is that certain proc sets from Adobe violate
the PLRM.  In the test file, the proc set is from Adobe Photoshop
Version 5.5.  The proce set contains tint transform functions which
violate the specification in two different ways.  In one case, the tint
transform function changes stack values outside of the given color value.
This is used as a test to see if the interpreter supports the given
duotone color space.  If so then the proc set creates a color space with
a tint transform which is unbalanced in its stack usage.  This could
cause a stack overflow/underflow during sampling of the tint transform.
Adobe apparently assumes that this tint transform is never executed
since the function starts with the name /NeverReached.

The fix involves checking the stack depth after each execution of the
tint transform function and verifying that it matches the correct
position given the number of function inputs and outputs.  If so then
the stack is returned to its original position and the sampling is
aborted.  Changes in lib/gs_sepr.ps make the tint transform sampling
logic more robust in case the tint transform modifies the top of the
stack.  (This occurs in this case since the tint transform is actually
popping extra items off of the stack.)  We also create a dummy tint
transform function if sampling fails.  The later was done to prevent
the /typecheck error and give pdfwrite something with which to work.

The patch defines a new device virtual function pattern_manage,
and a default implementation for it. The purpose is to inform
the device about pattern accumulation and to bypass the installation of
gx_device_pattern_accum when the device can handle the pattern command stream.

The new code is temporary disabled with PATTERN_STREAM_ACCUMULATION 0
macro defined in gx.h . When it is 0, the new device virtual
function is provided but never called. The behavior should not change.

The rest of this log message describes PATTERN_STREAM_ACCUMULATION 1.
In this mode pdfwrite doesn't convert PatternType 1 to rasters.
It creates good PDFs at least with 012-09.ps and 269-01.ps
(these are very complicated cases with patterns inside charprocs and patterns),
but there are problems when rasterizing the resulting PDFs with GS.
(A new bug 686834 issued for tracking this problem).

When a pattern stream is handled by the device,
we can't create a proper content of gx_color_tile.
However we need a correct content if the pattern is used
for rasterization of an object which the device can't handle
at the high level. An example is pdf14 device during a PDF re-distillation,
which handles transparency. Another example is
a conversion of composite fonts, which have multiple CID descendents -
pdfwrite still converts such fonts to raster fonts.

Since a proper contents may be needed for gx_device_color,
we define a new flag gx_color_tile::is_dummy, and account it in
gx_pattern_cache_lookup. Thus, if the current device is cache device
installed for the font conversion, the tiles with is_dummy == true
are being be dismissed. Vice versa, tiles with is_dummy == false are
being dismissed when current device is pdfwrite.

We do not move parts of zpcolor.c code to gx_default_pattern_manage,
because we don't see a proper place for it to be compatible to
the FEATURE_DEVS configurability. Instead that, we implement
a branching inside gsptype1.c and zpcolor.c . If more branches will
be necessary in future, this to be improved with moving code
fragments to specific implementations of pattern_manage,
together with improving the FEATURE_DEVS modularity.
Delaying this reorganization until a strong reason appears.

NOTE: The patch extends the device interface with gs_pattern1_instance_t.

Minor Changes :

1. Fixed some MSVC warnings.
2. gx_pattern_alloc_cache passed a wrong client ID to memory manager.
3. Skipped some unuseful graphic state parameters while a contents substream accumulation.

Switching to the new logics of resource file location.
THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, because the default resource path is now different :
resource files are moved to gs/Resource .
See gs/doc/Use.htm#Finding_files and gs/doc/Use.htm#Resource_related_parameters.

DETAILS:

This patch does not include necessary changes to Ghostscript installer.

The main code change in one to gp.h .
Rudiments of old code in gs/src and gs/lib are marked with NEW_COMBINE_PATH.
They to be removed after beta-testing.

Change to makefiles provide extended default values for
file search paths, which are platform dependent.

For convenience, here we summarize all related issues,
which were mentioned in previous patches :

1. The search method with multiple resource directories
   appears not fully conforming to PLRM. We cannot ever call
   ResourceFileName while executing findresource
   or resourcestatus, because per PLRM it always
   returns a single path. Therefore we implement
   an extended search method in findresource,
   resourcestatus and resourceforall, which first calls
   ResourceFileName and checks whether the returned path
   points to an existing file. If yes, the file is used,
   othervise we search all directories specified in
   LIB_PATH. With a single resource directory
   it appears equivalent to Adobe.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

2. ResourceFileName may be used for obtaining a path
   where a resource file to be installed. In this case
   Ghostscript to be invoked with -sGenericResourceDir=path,
   specifying an absolute path. The default value for
   GenericResourceDir is a relative path. Therefore
   a default invocation with a Postscript installer
   will install resources into gs/Resource.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

3. We do not distinguish lib and Resource directories.
   There is no file name conflicts because
   lib does not contain subdirectories, but Resource
   always store files in subdirectories.

4. We implement a new flag in gs_context_state,
   which informs lib_file_open whether it is invoked
   with a file specified in a command line argument.
   Doing so because command line argument files
   don't need to check permissions, and they
   are executed with a special PS operator .runfile .
   We cannot use a .runfile argument for passing this
   information, because it would be a security hole
   due to .runfile is available for documents
   and cannot be hidden.

5. We still have a security hole while loading
   resources from gs_init.ps .
   Both the old and the new code load some resources
   (such as CIDInit ProcSet) before entering
   the SAFER mode. Therefore it is a way for
   Postscript viruses to migrate.
   To be fixed later.

6. Default values for GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir
   are platform dependent.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).

7. Default value for GenericResourcePathSep is platform dependent.
   The value is used before non-directory items only.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).
   (The old code used the value before directory items - a bug on OpenVMS).

8. If a path starts with a number of parent references,
   a template with same number of parent references
   must be added to permission list to allow the access in SAFER mode.
   The template (*) allows access to any file.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, because
   the old code ever rejects parent directories.

9. GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir are not being added
   to permission list while .locksafe. Instead that,
   we generate (*/*) templates with all LIBPATH items.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, but for non-exotic cases
   (such as "(./Resource/CMap/H) .libfile" in a document)
   it should not be visible.

A. Scratch files with a non-absolute prefix always open
   in a scratch directory. The old code can open them
   in current and parent directories if an user modified
   a default prefix in C code.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE for users who had modified
   a scratch file prefix in C code.
   Permission for scratch directory is not checked
   as well as in old code.

B. The operator .filenamedirseparator is removed,
   because it cannot work properly on OpenVMS.
   On OpenVMS it needs both prefix and trailer to
   determine a correct separator.
   We removed it because the new logics never needs it.

C. The operator .pathstring_not_bare is removed,
   because .file_name_combine performs it's job better.

D. The functions gp_pathstring_not_bare, gp_file_name_references_parent,
   char *gp_file_name_concat_string are removed.

E. New operators added to maintain the new logics :

   <string> <string> <bool> .file_name_combine <string> true
   <string> <string> <bool> .file_name_combine <string> <string> false

      Combine a file name with a prefix.
      The first argument is a prefix, the second is a file name.
      Internal syntax of arguments and result is platform dependent.
      The combination is being reduced to a shortest equivalent,
      but if it starts with cwd reference, the starting
      cwd reference persists.

      If the <bool> argument is true, it considered to use the
      "no sibling" mode. It prevents reduction of
      (x/../y) to (y) for any x != y. With false such reduction
      is allowed. The <bool> argument appears a rudinemt from
      a dead branch. The new code always sets it to false.

      On success, the result is a combined, reduced path and false.
      On failure, the argument strings left on operand stack,
      followed with false.

   - .file_name_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between directory item and file item.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourcePathSep.

   - .file_name_directory_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between two directory items.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourceDir
      and FontResourceDir.

   - .file_name_current <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a reference
      to current working directory. Used for making the default
      value of GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir.

Add news script to generate split abbreviated/detailed changelogs in the new
format. Accepts xml input from the cvs2cl perl script.

DETAILS:

After the 8.00 release we switched to a new format for Changes.htm and the
History files, based on the more traditional Changelog format instead of
grouping commits by section, which often resulted in duplicate posts. At
the same time we began a convention of including any notes too extensive
for such a listing below a 'DETAILS:' separator, with the idea that we'd
create two changelogs, with hyperlinks between so detailed information was
still available even in the new easier to browse format.

The method we've adopted uses the cvs2cl perl script, available from
http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/ to parse the output of 'cvs log' and
generate an xml file containing the merged entries. This script is
more robust than our own cvs2hist. The split_changelog.py script is
then run to convert the xml changelog to the two sizes of linked html
changelogs.

split_changelog isn't very bright about constructing links, so it should
be run from inside the doc directory for now.

Initial commit of native MacOS font loading. This implements a %macresource% iodevice for
retrieving data from the 'resource' structure associated with MacOS files, either directly from
the resource fork, or from a serialized data fork resource file. This is primarily used to access
font data on that platform. Resource fork access is only supported on MacOS, while data fork files
(e.g. .dfont format font files) can be read on any platform. This code is currently disabled.

DETAILS:

This change allows fonts stored in resources to be specified in the fontmap. A special indexing
scheme is added to the filename to address the particular resource desired by id and 4-character
type code, e.g. '%macresource%Arial#sfnt+4096' or

Remove the non-HAVE_STDINT_H non-win32 attempts to define stdint types
and related sys/types redefine hacks. Also warn in the configure script
if stdint.h is not found.

DETAILS:

Compiling libjbig2dec requires the size-specific types in stdint.h, as
does compiling in the headers. Therefore these types must be made
available in ghostscript if jbig2.dev is included in FEATURE_DEVS.

The best way to integrate this is to create a stdint_.h for ghostscript
that contains discovered and/or platform-specific typedefs for the
types. This is still the plan, but to speed integration we just through
some defines into stdpre.h. If -DHAVE_CONFIG_H is passed by the makefile
(as configure does) then the C99 header is used, and we make specific
defines for MSVC which doesn't yet ship the header. We also had some
fallbacks for other systems (vendor unix mostly) but these caused
collisions with partial definitions of what became the C99 types in
sys/types.h and the redirection hack we do with ulong et al. did not
work on all platforms (notably macosx).

It is the fallback defines that have been removed; users building
on older platforms will probably have to patch the types in to use JBIG2
support.

pdfwrite : The old code copied parameters of PS interpreter's graphic state
to the output PDF. However some of them are installation dependent and must not copy.
THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE : the generated PDFs will render some differently
on printers.

DETAILS:

We provide a signal to pdfwrite at very end of gs_init.ps - see
the change to gs_pdfwr.ps, the priority=2000.
The signal is handled in gdev_pdf_fill_path,
and stores a copy of PS interpreter's graphic state parameter values.
Those valuess are used for comparizon with current parameters of PS interpreter
when an object is written. Therefore, if a value of a parameter was not
changed by a document, it is not written to PDF.

Note that if a PS document sets parameters equal to the
installation defaults, the setting in missed in PDF.
This is unfortunate.

The patch causes multiple differences in rendering distilled
comparefiles with pkmraw, because transfer functions changed from a
HP-specific (defined in gs_init.ps) to none. Those differences were
checked with the fuzzy compare utility and look fine. It should fix
the 2003-03-26 regressions, but new differences will appear.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Provide a complete monitoring of the viewer's graphic state
while generating a PDF output. The old code misses the synchronization
of the viewer's graphic state with its internal copy when generating
a 'grestore' command to undo a clipping.
Bug 686763 "pdfwrite is not correctly handling OPM distiller parameter".

DETAILS :

This change affects all vector devices, but it should be equivalent
for all them except pdfwrite, and except for the pointer lifetime bug
explained below.

Here is an example when the desynchronization appears :

  f1 settransfer
  0 setcolor
  path1 fill
  f2 settransfer
  1 setcolor
  path2 fill
  gsave
  path3 clip
  path4 fill
  grestore
  path5 fill

After 'grestore' it uses f1 instead f2.

The old code does not remember the viewer's graphic state,
which was immediately before 'gsave', and resets the internal copy of
the graphic state to default values when it generates 'grestore'.
This logic is fully wrong : if after 'grestore' a parameter is equal
to the default value, pdfwrite does not generate a set command for this parameter,
but the viewer uses the value which was set before 'grestore',
which can differ from the default one.

Moreover, gdevvec copies the device color from local memory
to global memory, and doesn't ask garbager to process pointers in
the copy. When the device color contains pointers
to patterns or so, the live time of the copy appears bigger
than the live time of the pointed structure. The old code only
compares the pointed addresses without accessing the pointed data,
so that a crash can't happen. But if garbager moves another color
to same address, the comparison answers "equal" when actually colors
are not equal, and the generated PDF appears wrong.

To exclude the pointer lifetime problem, the patch uses the 'save_dc' method
instead the 'equal' method for colors. But the implementation
of save_dc was dummy for patterns. To complete it, gs_id is
inserted into gs_pattern_instance_s, and more variants added to
gx_device_color_saved_s. The clist device appears tolerant
to this change.

Note that macros color_unset, color_set_null, color_is_null,
gx_dc_is_null are now applied to gx_device_color_saved.

For complete monitoring the viewer's graphic state,
we implement a 2-elements stack 'vgstack' in gx_device_pdf_s,
save the viewer's graphic state in it when generating 'q' commands,
and restore from there when generating 'Q'. If a 'gs' parameter
needs to change, we move to 'PDF_IN_STREAM' context, because
we must not insert 'gs' into a text context. New functions
pdf_try_prepare_stroke and pdf_try_prepare_fill provide
the "try" logics for this.

If a 'gs' parameter changes with changing a clipping,
first we need to undo the old clipping with 'Q',
and then generate new 'gs' parameters relatively to the
restored graphic state. The new function pdf_unclip
works for this.

With this patch the length of generated PDF appears longer
for some tests. The most important ones are :

acrobat.pdf        Lengths differ in 6141.
adesso8.pdf        Lengths differ in -8316.
HeiseiMinStd.pdf   Lengths differ in 4000.
narrow_font.pdf    Lengths differ in 6141.
RealCities.pdf     Lengths differ in 12370.
RodinCIDEmbed.pdf  Lengths differ in 101698.

It happens because pdfwrite doesn't remember 'gs' dictionaries,
and therefore redundant copies can appear.
This problem to be fixed separately.

Expecting a progression : 093-01.ps (was a wrong stroke widths with a PaintType 2 font).

Expecting a regression : with this patch, re-distilled
    Testform.v1.0.2.pdf paints good with Adobe, but wrongly with GS.
                         Maybe a bug in GS PDF interpreter.

stdpre.h already contains a number of typedefs and includes sys/types.h
to provide expected basic types. We use stdint.h itself if the toplevel
makefile defines HAVE_STDINT_H.

Note that unfortunately sys/types.h often tries to provide types now in
stdint.h. We do the same collision-avoidance we do with our shorthand
types, but this could clobber correct definitions for the explicitly-
sized types on systems without stdint.h. (The only mainstream platform
not shipping stdint.h is MSVC, and we provide specific typedefs for that

Some systems also provide a sys/inttypes.h with the same definitions. We
ignore this.

findresource was buggy : it returned a path with GenericResourceDir

Now it first searches in LIBPATH, and if not found calls ResourceFileName .

We can't ever call ResourceFileName from findresource,

Fix (pdfwrite) : When advance width has non-zero y component, the width was set to zero.
Bug 686764 "Overlapping characters".

DETAILS :

The test document embeds a font, in which some characters
have a small non-zero y component of the advance width.
It looks as a buggy font. The pdfwrite writes zero to Widths array
(that's correct, because it is only useful with zero y component),
and did not generate glyph positioning commands (the bug).
This patch makes pdfwrite to be tolerant to such buggy fonts
with generating glyph position for subsequent glyph.
It does not repair the font.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Unwinding a part of the previous patch
and improve the OS/2 table writing ann embedded CIDFontType2.
Bugzilla Bug 686759 "pdf to pdf doesnt work".

DETAILS :

The previous patch appears wrong and caused a regression
due to the change to "have_cmap = no_generate && !writing_cid,"
in gdevpsft.c . This patch unwinds it. Also the log message
of the previous patch is fully wrong. The CID font in the test document
for 686759 does not contain cmap and the cmap must not
be written. But with the previous patch a corrupt cmap
was written. Accessing the wrong font copy pdfwrite
failed to compute glyph widths and therefore converted the font
into a bitmap font. This patch restores the code
to "have_cmap = no_generate,". The bug 686759 is reopened.

Also we detected that the OS/2 table was written
wrongly in some circumstances : its position in font
file did not correspond to one specified in the font
header. This patch fixes it.

Add pngalpha device that uses RGBA, with the alpha channel
providing pixel coverage.  Used for generating PNG images with a
transparent background.

DETAILS
Add missing initialiser for get_clipping_box to
prn_color_params_procs macro.  (src/gdevprn.h)

Avoid cast warning for software_key (src/gdevpng.c).

Add pngalpha device that uses RGBA.  This requires custom
encode_color and decode_color procedures to put RGB in the
first three bytes while leaving the fourth A byte as opaque.
To avoid gx_no_color_value, the alpha is stored inverted so
opaque is 0x00 and transparent is 0xff.

If pngalpha is told to fill the entire page with white, it uses
the kludge of instead filling with almost white and transparent
(0xfefefeff). This works because it is triggered by "erasepage",
but not by "1 setgray clippath fill". A custom open_device and
put_params are needed to save the clist or memory device
fill_rectangle, and to restore the pngalpha_fill_rectangle.

A custom copy_alpha is required to correctly blend RGBA. The
blend is based on pixel coverage, not true transparency
Ghostscript doesn't pass transparency to the device. Alpha blend
maths from Porter and Duff 1984 paper for "A over B". RGB values
are stored without pre-multiplication. A custom
pngalpha_create_buf_device is used to replace the memory device
implementation gx_default_copy_alpha with pngalpha_copy_alpha,
but not to replace clist_copy_alpha.

The pngalpha device is successful at giving a transparent
background to many images such as colorcir.ps and golfer.eps,
but not tiger.eps which fills the clipping path with grey.
It does not implement a transparent background for PDF 1.4

DETAILS:

The test document creates a Type 3 font, in which BuildChar

WeightVector in it.

A new PS operator introduced to handle it.
Adobe implementations do so.

We are not happy with the change of VM with no regard to 'restore'.
It appears compatible with the test document,
because it calls setweightvector before rendering each glyph.
(Another interesting point is that the test document executes
"0 setcachelimit" before rendering a glyph).
But it is not compatible to CPSI (a special test done).
Providing a correct restore appears too complicated -
need to change the data representation to 'ref'.

Alternatively we could obtain a fresh copy of WeightVector

file_name_combine : (1) Implement the extended search method in resourceforall,
resourcestatus, ResourceFileName. (2) Don't check permissions for command line argument files.

DETAILS:

This patch does not change any behavior with a regular build.

To skip the permission check with argument files we added a flag into
gs_context_state. This is only a secure way to pass the information
across PS interpreter, which executes .runfile with any argument file.

Per Adobe specification, a resource category can define the ResourceFileName procedure,
which generates a resource file name from resource instance name.
Since Ghostscript uses an extended search method for finding resource files,
the strong Adobe's semantics appears inapplicable.
Ghostscript implements an extended semantics.

Finding a resource file while executing findresource or resourcestatus,
Ghostscript does not call ResourceFileName. Instead that, it searches directories
with an extended method explained in How Ghostscript finds files.

ResourceFileName may be called from a Postscript program such as a resource installer.
The default implementation for ResourceFileName first checks whether
GenericResourceDir specifies an absolute path. If so, ResourceFileName uses its value
to generate the result. Otherwise, it tries to find an existing resource file with
the extended method. If it succeeds, ResourceFileName returns the path
to the resource file found. Otherwise it uses GenericResourceDir to combine a default path.

Note that with a single resource directory and an absolute ResourceFileName the behavior
appears equivalent to Adobe's one.

The new search method doesn't distinguish 'lib' and 'Resource' directories.

Minor changes :

The operator .file_name_parent is removed.
The operator .file_name_current is removed.
Improved some error messages.

Initial commit for the new SAFER logics.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior unless
NEW_COMBINE_PATH is changed to 1. With 0 a minor meanful
change is the replacing .pathstring_not_bare with .file_name_combine
in gs_fapi.ps (which fixes a bug in FAPI support,
and doesn't affect builds with no FAPI).

The change is compatible unless NEW_COMBINE_PATH is 1.
Incompatibility issues with 1 are explained below.

With NEW_COMBINE_PATH 1 the patch defines a new logic for
.libfile, SAFER, and related things :

1. Default values for GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir
   are platform dependent.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).

2. Default value for GenericResourcePathSep is platform dependent.
   The value is used before non-directory items only.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).
   (The old code used the value before directory items - a bug on OpenVMS).

3. PLRM specifies GenericResourceDir to be a single absolute path name.
   But Ghostscript's tradition is to load library files
   form a list of directories. Since we want to propagate
   this tradition to resource files, we get a conflict.
   To resolve the conflict, we allow GenericResourceDir
   to be a relative path, which is being concatenated with
   LIBPATH items. Thus we provide an extension of Postscript.

4. When a LIBPATH item is being concatenated with GenericResourceDir,
   an abnormal behavior appears when GenericResourceDir references parent.
   Exactly, concatenating the (.) item of LIBPATH with
   the default GenericResourceDir, which is (../Resource/),
   we get (../Resource/), i.e. it searches in a directory,
   which users don't expect to. We work around the abnormal
   behavior with skipping such paths while executing .libfile .

   More precisely, the .libpath algorithm is :

   For each LIBPATH item :
      - combine it with the argument string;
      - if the (reduced) combination refers the parent, skip it;
      - otherwise try to open the path. If succeeded, exit with it.
   If no success, fail with undefinedfilename or invalidfileaccess.

   Here and below we used Unix notation just for simplifying
   the log message. All statements to be generalized for any platform,
   and they are true for any supported platform.

5. A consequence of our workaround for (4) is a new constraint to .libfile :

   Let x is a cwd.
   Let x/../y exists. Lets mark it as y1.
   Let LIBPATH contains cwd and a directory z, which is not cwd.
   Let z/../y exists. Lets mark it as y2.
   Consequently y1 != y2.
   Executing

      (../y/f) .libpath

   searches y2/f, but does not search y1/f .
   The old code searched both in non-safer mode.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

6. A better workaround for (4) would be an implementation
   of RESPATH, which by default generates from LIBPATH
   with replacing (../Resource/) with (./Resource/).
   This requires to maintain a new directory lists.
   .libfile should get an additional argument,
   which specifies a search list - LIBPATH, RESPATH or FONTPATH.
   We do not make this improvement now,
   but will add it to Issues.htm .

7. If a path starts with a number of parent references,
   a template with same number of parent references
   must be added to permission list to allow the access.
   The template (*) allows access to any file.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, because
   the old code ever rejects parents.

8. GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir are not being added
   to permission list while .locksafe. Instead that,
   we combine them with all LIBPATH items,
   and add the combinations to the permission list
   unless it references parent.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, but for non-exotic cases
   (such as "(../Resource/CMap/H) .libfile" in a document)
   it should be equivalent to the old behavior.

9. Scratch files with a non-absolute prefix always open
   in a scratch directory. The old code can open them
   in current and parent directories if an user modified
   a default prefix in C code.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE for users who had modified
   a scratch file prefix in C code.
   Permission for scratch directory is not checked
   as well as in old code.

A. The operator .filenamedirseparator is removed,
   because it cannot work properly on OpenVMS.
   On OpenVMS it needs both prefix and trailer to
   determine a correct separator.
   We removed it because the new logics never needs it.

B. The operator .pathstring_not_bare is removed,
   because .file_name_combine performs it's job better.

C. The functions gp_pathstring_not_bare, gp_file_name_references_parent,
   char *gp_file_name_concat_string are not longer in use.

D. New operators added to maintain the new logics :

   <string> <string> .file_name_combine <string>

      Combine a file name with a prefix.
      The first argument is a prefix, the second is a file name.
      Internal syntax of arguments and result is platform dependent.
      The combination is being reduced to a shortest equivalent,
      but if it starts with cwd reference, the starting
      cwd reference persists.

   - .file_name_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between directory item and file item.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourcePathSep.

   - .file_name_directory_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between two directory items.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourceDir.

   - .file_name_parent <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a parent reference.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourceDir
      and GenericResourceDir.

   <string> .file_name_parents <integer>

      Returns an integer equal to the length of maximal
      anchor substring, which includes parent references and separators only.
      Used in generating the permission list from LIBPATH and
      [GenericResourceDir FontResourceDir] as a workaround
      for (6).

   We believe that all them are necessary, except the last one,
   which is temporary used in (8) as a workaround for (6).

gp_file_name_combine : Implementing some useful functions.

DETAILS:

This patch doesn't change any behavior.
The new functions will be used with NEW_COMBINE_PATH=1.

Probably we don't need gp_file_name_reduce, but it's implementation
is pretty nice and isn't obvious.

gp_file_name_is_absolute will replace gp_pathstring_not_bare.
NEW_COMBINE_PATH=1 wan't need a special check for cwd.

gp_file_name_is_from_parent will replace gp_file_name_references_parent.
The new function only check partent at the beginning of the path,
and should be used with reduced paths only.

We could code an in-place reduction with :

    gp_file_name_combine_result
    gp_file_name_reduce_inplace(char *buffer, uint *blen)
    {
        return gp_file_name_reduce(buffer, *blen, buffer, blen);
    }

but we believe that

1. Aliasing const with non-const isn't a valid C.
   Rather GS contains multiple const hacks, we don't want to add another one.

2. The input buffer must have space for the trailing zero,
   which is not accounted in *blen.

The patch also includes a minor cleanup of comments and gp_file_name_combine_generic.

Implementing gp_file_name_combine.

DETAILS :

This patch introduces a new code, which is currently
disabled with "#define NEW_COMBINE_PATH 0" in gp.h .

The new function gp_file_name_combine concatenates
two paths and then reduce the concatenation with excluding
parent references when possible. It is platform dependent,
but we could factor out a big common part - see gp_file_name_combine_generic.
Platforms define 8 small helpers for it.

The gp_file_name_combine and its helpers were debugged on Windows
with emulating other platforms. A help wanted to
test them on real platforms. For testing them
replace 0 with 1 in the definition of NEW_COMBINE_PATH
in gp.h and rebuild.

We do not protect definitions of new functions with
NEW_COMBINE_PATH switch, because we want them to be syntax-checked.

Some old functions, such as gp_pathstring_not_bare,
gp_file_name_concat_string will be reconsidered later,
because the helpers perform similar work in a generalized way.
Probably some of old ones to be removed. Our strong intention is
to remove gp_pathstring_not_bare, because it's behavior looks
strange from the user's end.

Support for JBIG2 streams with a JBIG2Globals shared data reference.

DETAILS:

The JBIG2Decode filter can take an optional /JBIG2Globals parameter,
always an indirect object reference to another stream. This commit adds
a new .jbig2makeglobalctx operator that takes a bytestring contanting
the global stream data, runs it through the decoder library and wraps
the resulting context pointer in an astruct which is returned as a
special -jbig2globalctx- object on the postscript stack.

A new procedure called from inside applyfilters in the pdf decoder takes
care of spooling the global data into the bytestring and installing the
astruct under the .jbig2globalctx key in the parameter dictionary. The
filter implementation looks for this and passes it to the page decoder
instance if it's available. The original JBIG2Globals key is ignored by
the actual decode filter implementation.

Fixing the device finalization problem.

DETAILS :

pdfwrite (and possibly other devices) perform a huge work within close_device.
Since close_device is called via finalization method from memory
manager, some device structures could be released before calling
device_close, so that the huge work could not safely complete.
Also it could return error codes, which were entirely lost.

This patch calls gs_closedevice implicitly when a device
is about to uninstall. We catch 2 such events : when the interpreter
is about to exit, and when the interpreter executes setdevice.
This should be enough for "external" devices, such as printer drivers.
Internal devices do not receive these calls.

Note that a call to gx_device_fill_in_procs is added after assign_dev_procs
from gx_default_create_buf_device. Not sure why it was not done before.
After assign_dev_procs, ppmraw had ununitialized procs.

Also note that is_open flag is now unconditionally resets in gs_closedevice.
The new code needs to reset it to prevent redundant call to close_device from
device finalization method. The redundant call causes
a crash if pdfwrite has insufficient disk space to store the
output file (debugged with dina3_watermark.pdf) .

This is initial commit for implementing static resources.

DETAILS :

1. Adding a new iodevice %static% with the new file ziodevst.c .
It is used for opening files placed in static data segment.
They need to be accessed as PS files due to multiple reasons,
including the implementation of gs_ciddc.ps and for PS procedure
ResourceFileName defined in PLRM.

2. Implementing a queue for delayed invocation
of initialization functions at end of gs_init.
This feature is necessary due to customized
builds of Ghostscript : some 'dev' depend each
on other and some functions are needed to execute
after all devs are preset. Currently it is only used
for obtaining the Unicode Decoding resource,
but later it will be used for perfectly consistent
processing of font and CID font map files,
both with FAPI and without it.

3. gs_resmp.ps slightly changed for handling
resource maps which are not defined as files.

4. The new file gs_resst.ps implements a procset
for handling static resource files. Both gs_resst.ps and
gs_ciddc.ps use the %static% iodevice.

5. The new file gs_resst.ps creates a map of resource files
placed in static segment. Later it would be nice
to generate it during GS installation. With the defined
resource set gs_init.obj grows up to 1.5Meg,
but both MSVC and gcc/Cygwin could handle it.

Currently all resources in gs_stres.ps are COMMENTED OUT
to prevent problems building Ghostscript with COMILE_INITS=1
on Mac and VMS. To uncomment them, replace '%-' with empty string.

This patch was locally tested with entire comparefiles
with COMPILE_INITS=0. It should not cause regressions.
Also it was slightly tested with COMPILE_INITS=1 :
the static resources work fine.

The patch assumes that during a GS build resource files
are placed in gs/Resource/ . It uses 1 Decoding and
a dozen of CMaps, which are necessary for the CID font emulation
and for FAPI to work. You need to uncomment them
in gs_stres.ps .

When GS is invoked, resources are being loaded from both
the static segment and from the OLD(!!!!!) default path.
In other words, the resource machinery works fine,
but the default resource path is not fixed yet.
I intend to fix it in the next day or two.

The patch depends on
http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-cvs/2003-February/002950.html

The patch does not include CMaps and Decodings resources.
They to be added separately.

Fix : Improving the CIDFontType 2 font copying.

DETAILS :

I believe that the code about copying CIDFontType 2 glyphs
is overcomplicated with mixing CIDs and GIDs, and needs to be
cleaned up. The old code had an obvious inconsistency :
it allocated a smaller array for glyph indices than written,
causing a heap damage. This patch simply makes the code to be
self-consistent. I can't say that I completely
understand whether CIDs/GIDs passed correctly or not.
Now it is working, but the correctness was not proved,
and Acrobat Reader doesn't show the glyph with /CIDTTEMUL
(see below).

The problem was detected with COMPILE_INITS=1 with emulating
a CID wont with mshei.ttf . The following program had crashed
with pdfwrite :

/glyph 2300 def
/ShinGo-Bold /CIDFont findresource
100 scalefont setfont
100 200 moveto glyph glyphshow
/CIDTTEMUL /CIDFont findresource
100 scalefont setfont
100 100 moveto glyph glyphshow
showpage

with the cidfmap file like this :

/ShinGo-Bold << /FileType /TrueType /Path (f:/WIN2000/Fonts/batang.ttf) /SubfontID 0 /CSI [(Japan1) 2] >> ;
/CIDTTEMUL << /FileType /TrueType /Path (f:/WIN2000/Fonts/mshei.ttf) /SubfontID 0 /CSI [(Japan1) 2] >> ;

The effect is indeterministic.
When I build GS with regenerate gs_init.c,
it crashed if run in same session of Developer Studio.
But if I close-open the Developer Studio and run GS,
it doesn't crash.

The patch should enlarge the array, which was written outside
the index range. The problem looks gone.
Meanwhile the CID/GID logics in gxcopy.c to be revised someday.

pdfwrite : Account GlyphNames2Unicode while creating ToUnicode CMaps for simple fonts.

DETAILS:

This patch improves the previous one.
It generalizes the GlyphNames2Unicode processing for any simple font.

GlyphNames2Unicode is an undocumented facility, which Adobe Postscript
printer driver PScript5.dll Version 5.2 uses to communicate with
Adobe Distiller. Adobe applies it to Type 3 and Type 42 fonts.

Adobe uses Type 3 with GlyphNames2Unicode only for compatibility
with interpreters, which cannot handle Type 32. With other
interpreters (including Ghostscript) the generated PS program
skips GlyphNames2Unicode data. Therefore the feature
is now implemented for Type 3 but it is not involved while
processing such documents. Need to patch "32 /FontType findresource"
to involve it. Probably with pdfwrite the DSC parser should recognize
the creator and exclude 32 from /FontType resource category.

This patch unwinds the enhanced functionality of gs_font_procs::glyph_info
with GLYPH_INFO_UTC16, which was done with the previous patch,
and introduces a new virtual function gs_font_procs::decode_glyph.
Doing so because GLYPH_INFO_UTC16 causes multiple redundant code
for various font types due to dependence on interpreter structures.

SF bug #684120 tracks additional issues.

GlyphNames2Unicode is an undocumented facility, which Adobe Postscript
printer driver PScript5.dll Version 5.2 uses to communicate with
Adobe Distiller. Adobe applies it to Type 3 and Type 42 fonts.

Type 3 with GlyphNames2Unicode is used only for compatibility
with interpreters, which cannot handle Type 32.
Since Ghostscript is not such, there is no need to implement
Type 3 with GlyphNames2Unicode. We don't do that.

This patch enhances the functionality of gs_font_procs::glyph_info
with retrieving Unicode UTC-16 code for a glyph. This enhancement
is implemented for practically useful cases only, which are
restricted with Type 42.

The gs_font_dir::glyph_to_unicode
callback is now removed because it is not longer useful.

SF bug #684120 tracks additional issues.

Working on this patch, I tried put the Unicode Decoding table
as a default value to FontInfo.GlyphNames2Unicode and remove the unicode_decoder.
But it appears not working, because test.ps for SF bug #529103 needs to
collect substitutions from both FontInfo.GlyphNames2Unicode and Unicode Decoding.

I removed the "WARNING: /Unicode /Decoding resource in not accessible",
because the flag for preventing its repetitions is not accessible from
gs_font_procs::glyph_info. A similar warning in lib/gs_pdfwr.ps still works.

The display device (src/gdevdsp.c) was displaying pure magenta as

DETAILS:
The cause of the problem was a sign bit extention in a 32 to 64
bit conversion (long to gx_color_index).  The fix was to add casts
to force the conversion to gx_color_index (which is unsigned) earlier
in the assigment.

pdfwrite : Generating ToUnicode CMaps for simple fonts.
For fonts with random encoding it allows to Copy-Paste text
from viewers and to search a text.

DETAILS:

This code requires /Unicode /Decoding resource.
If the resource is absent, PDF will be written without ToUnicode CMap,
a warning is written to stdout explaining that the resource may be useful,
and another warning may be written to stderr if the resource is actually
useful for the document.

To access the resource I introduced a special operator .setupUnicodeDecoder .
It is called from gs_pdfwr.ps and stores the resource to gs_font_dir,
together with a callback which performs the decoding.
This is only a way to pass the resource through the graphics library.
It is definitely not a device parameter, and converting it to
C structures would be hard.

I don't like the big stuff added into zfont.c, but I haven't got
a better idea where to put it.

The CID to TT mapping : Building CIDMap with SubstNWP.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior if a new file
gs/lib/cidttmap is not added. Normally it is not.

With this patch narrow, wide and proportional Romans
may substitute each another while emulating a CJK CID font
with True Type font. Usually True Types contain insufficient
glyph to render all them. The substitution prevents missed glyphs.

This patch introduces a new special operator .fillCIDMap .
It composes a CID map from a Decoding, a True Type cmap,
and SubstNWP. PS code would be too big and slow for this purpose.

The implementation of the CID font emulator is almost complete except 2 features :

DETAILS:

This is a next step of the CID font emulation.
Now it can handle all Windows JCK charsets, including Unicode-16.
In other words, a CJK font with any Windows charset can be used for emulation.
To handle other CJK charsets one should create an appropriate
CIDDecoding resource and add it into gs/lib/xlatmap.

The CID to TT mapping :
1. Providing an access to glyphs on demand.
2. Handle TTC font format.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior if a new file
gs/lib/cidttmap is not added. Normally it is not.

With this patch glyf and loca tables are being skipped while loading
a True Type into RAM. An access by demand is provided instead
(This works for CIDFontType 2; it is not used for Type 42).

Map file may contain records with SubfontID, which
specifies a font number in a TTC collection.
TTC format is implemented for disk files only,
because embedded fonts never use it.

To provide the on-demand access, the patch introduces a special
extension of the Postscript language.
A CIDFontType 2 dictionary may contain /File with a file value.
It should be a positionable file of the TTF or TTC format.
When it presents, the dictionary must contain /file_table_pos,
which's value is a dictionary of 2-element arrays, which specify
position and length of a TT table in the file. 2 arrays
must present with keys /loca and /glyph.

We would like to optimize this implementation.

DETAILS:

This patch only changes a code which work for

This is a next step of the CID font emulation.
Now it correctly maps most CIDs to Unicode fonts.

Secondary changes :

- I made xlatmap accessible from gs_ttf.c .

- improving some comments and function names.

- Removed a redundant definition of a CIDFont,

Enhancing the resource machinery with mapping CID fonts to True Types.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior if a new file
gs/lib/cidttmap is not added. Normally it is not.

Adding 2 new files gs_fntem.ps and gs_cidtt.ps and reorganizing
old files gs_cidfn.ps, gs_fapi.ps, gs_resmp.ps with them.
This moves a part of FAPI support to a more general level.
The moved stuff is shared with the FAPI and the new CID font mapper.

After this change Ghostscript can load Unicode True Type fonts
as a substitution to a CIDFontType 2 and render it.
At least the Windows font PMINGLIU.TTF succeeds.
But the implementation is very incomplete :

1. The CID to GID mapping is fully wrong.

2. Entire True Type fonts are loaded into VM.

3. The CID font to CID font mapper and
   the True Type to CID font mapper use different map files -
   cidfmap and cidttmap.

All these 3 solutions are temporary and to be improved later.

To involve the new feature, create a new file gs/lib/cidttmap,
and put records to there of the following format :

/ShinGo-Bold  << /FileType /TrueType /Path (F:/WIN2000/Fonts/PMINGLIU.TTF) /CSI [(Japan1) 2] /SubstNWP /Japan1 >> ;

It is similar to gs/lib/FAPIcidfmap, see Use.htm about the latter.

<blockquote><pre>
Implementing a new user parameter AlignToPixels and
a new command line argument AlignToPixels.
They allow to choose the alignment of glyphs to
integral pixels or to subpixels while a text rendering.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior except
-dAlignToPixels=0 is specified.

A change to documentation about the new parameter is included.

With NEW_TYPE1_HINTER = 1 the value 0 of AlignToPixels implies :

1. Caching a glyph raster, fractional glyph origins
give different images, which are stored
in individual slots. The space consumption in the
character cache increases. This happens for all font types.

2. While hinting a Type 1 or 2 font, glyph origins and widths
are rounded to subpixels rather than to pixels, and the grid fitting
is done to the subpixel grid.

CIDFontType 0 descendents had NULL pointer to gs_font_dir.
The new code needs to access the font directory,
so the pointer is now set.

The new code needs glyph origin and log2_scale to lookup
a glyph in cache. Therefore show_proceed and
set_cache_device were reorganized with a new function
compute_glyph_raster_params. The new algorithm uses a
slightly different (and more complicated) logics
for computation and initialization of penum->origin.
It was well tested, but in case of problems please
consider it as a weak point.

New Type 1 hinter : (1) It did not work with pdfwrite because
gx_path_init_bbox_accumulator doesn't provide a memory.
(2) Coded an alignment to subpixels.
(3) Removed a hack about suppressing a microscopic segment.

DETAILS:

This patch changes a disabled code only.

It codes an alignment to subpixels, but for a while
it is permanently turned off.

gx_path_init_bbox_accumulator is used by gs_default_glyph_info for
computing a bounding box for a glyph. It does not
store segments to memory, therefore a reference to memory manager
is not provided. But the new hinter accesses it
if a stack-allocated array overflows.

Implementing an immediate transfer of outline poles to
the output path without storing them intermediately in arrays.
This mode works when a grid fitting is not required.
Only exception is flex poles : up to 9 of them
are stored in arrays while flex accumulates.
It must not overflow arrays.

The hack about microscopic segment was a rudiment of old code.
gs_op1_closepath was unintentionally called while
exporting an outline from the hinter. I believe that
the hack is incorrect and should not be applied.
Some outlines render differently.

I'm sorry for mixing 3 things in a single patch.
I've started the subpixel alignment, and
then occasionally discovered other problems.
It's hard to separate changes after they are done,
and I don't think that the separation is so important.

pdfwrite : Implementing widthshow and xshow for composite and CID fonts.
The old (default) implementation converted to raster fonts
and gave inaccurate glyph positions. The new implementation doesn't
convert fonts to raster except for Type 3.

DETAILS:

This also closes the Source Forge bug
"[ 663635 ] ps2pdf cannot tune spacing by xshow for CJK text".
and provides better glyph positions with ashow for WMode 1.

There are small changes to graphics library :

1. Added interface function gx_current_char, which retrieves
   a code of current character from a gs_text_enum_t instance.
   The function was factored out from an old code.

2. Provided a default metrics for CID fonts for WMode 1.
   This is done pretty roughly, because the interface
   function glyph_info cannot pass some necessary information (WMode).

Minor changes :

1. Removed the comment "We know that the Tw and Tc values are zero",
   It was wrong a long time ago.

2. Inserted a comment about unimplemented DW2. An old code near the
   comment depends on the fact that DW2 is not implemented.

This patch brings more access to gs_text_enum_t::fstack
around the defined interface functions.

of "long" for gx_color_index was the default prior to the

Reducing the C stack consumption in ztype1execchar.
The new code must be equivalent to the old one.

DETAILS:

The new type 1 hinter (with NEW_TYPE1_HINTER = 1 in gx.h)
puts more 11K of data to C stack. Perhaps due to a recursion
in bbox_draw 2 instances of the hinter were placed in C stack
simultaneously, causing C stack overflow with gswin32c.exe on
Windows NT 4.0 (but not on Windows 2000).

Perhaps the recursion is not necessary.
Reorganizing the sequence of calls to avoid the recursion.
New argument 'exec_cont' was added to several
functions for transferring the call request to clients.
Corresponding comments are added in code.

Also z1_glyph_info prototype was added in ichar1.h .
It was missed a long time ago, Cygwin/gcc warned.

A further improvement may be done with factoring out
a common code from bbox_finish_fill, bbox_finish_stroke,
bbox_fill, bbox_stroke. Delaying it until a regression testing.

Include libz in the autoconf test for libpng.

DETAILS:

This is a fix for systems without interlibrary dependencies. We don't use
the LIBS variable constructed by default by the AC_CHECK_LIB macro and
did not maintain it in our previous zlib test, thus -lz was not included
on the link line in the libpng test.

Our primary test systems for the autoconf build (Debian GNU/Linux and MacOS X + fink)
include an interlibrary dependency, so this did not cause a problem. On
systems where this is not the case, it results in a confusing error.

Dropout prevention : (1) Replace the horizontal line processing.

This patch changes a disabled code only.

DETAILS:

With the old type 1 hinter, hinted outlines get
self-intersections at small resolution. It's a problem
of the old hinter. Perhaps it discovered a defect
in horizontal line handling.

With self-intersections, the side of spot interior
may be different for different parts of same line.
This patch completely replaces the handling of
horizontal lines. It maintains 2 lists of
horizontal lines, which correspond to y and y1
in fill_loop_by_trapezoids. Then we intersect those
lines with margins and add corresponding segments
of boundaries separately for each part delimited
with an intersection.

Initial commit for a new type 1 hinter.
This patch must not change any behavior.

DETAILS:

This is a porting from HINTER branch.

The old hinter cannot handle overlapping hints,
but real fonts do use them.

The handling of overlapped hints cannot be done within
a single-pass algorithm. Therefore we intend to replace entire thing.
Besides, it should fix a set of known problems :

- stem degradation at small resolutions;
- stem missing or misrecognition;
- proper adjustment of dependent stems;
- suppress overshoots closer to Adobe;

This patch introduces a couple of new macros,
which will be removed later.

For switching to the new hinter, change the definition of
NEW_TYPE1_HINTER in gx.h . It is not well debugged yet.

New files added : gxhintn.c, gxhintn.h .

important with CJK True Types, which have thing horizontal
stems and no hinting with GS.

This revision replaces the representation of margins

Improving and optimizing the dropout prevention algorithm
with splitting gx_default_fill_parallelogram into 2 variants.

DETAILS:

This patch almost changes a disabled code.
A simple reorganization of some enabled code should not
cause a behavior difference.

Filling a "small" character, we always subdivide trapezoids into
rectangles instead passing them to device virtual function.
It allows :

1. Not passing narrow trapezoids to applications
which implement fill_trapezoid with own means;
Narrow trapezoids could cause dropouts in there.

2. Optimize variants of fill_trapezoid algorithm which
are used for different purposes (preventing about 10% slowdown
with shadings).

We believe this change isn't harmful because
regularly we render small characters to cache device,
which simply forwards trapezoids to default implementation.
Alternatively we could insert a check for narrow trapezoids
into loop_fill_trap, but such check appears complex and
it would sensibly reduce performance.

New files added : gdevddrw.h, gxdtfill.h .
Change to lib.mak accounts them.

Besides that, with dropout prevention we now skip empty paths
in characters, because Adobe doesn't paint them.

Initial commit for the dropout prevention code in rasterizer.
It doesn't not change any behavior.

DETAILS:

Switching to new code is being controlled with DROPOUT_PREVENTION
macro defined in gx.h . Now it is set to "use old code".

This patch :
1. Ports the "margin" algorithm from HINTER branch.
   Now the algorithm renamed to "pseudo-rasterization".

2. Ports the dropout prevention to gx_default_fill_trapezoid from HINTER branch,
   providing a contiguous fill for slightly slanted trapezoids.

3. Adds CONNECT_RECTANGLES into gx_default_fill_trapezoid
   providing a contiguous fill for highly slanted trapezoids.

4. Fixes some problems in the "pseudo-rasterization".

5. Disables all hacks about path adjustment and oversampling
   when DROPOUT_PREVENTION is on. Those hacks were attempts
   to fix dropouts for small characters, but they do not solve
   the problem completely.

6. Provide visual trace instructions for debugging purpose.

Changes to gxpcopy.c and gxpflat.c only insert visual trace instructions for
debugging purpose. Currently all them compile to empty code.

Changes to gdevddrw.c, gxchar.c, gxtype1.c, gx.h
are protected with DROPOUT_PREVENTION. With current settings they
compile to old code.

Changes to gxfill.c are not so obvious. I was unhappy with duplicating
a thousand of lines in #if...#else...#endif. Therefore
I've inserted some dynamic checks. They are controlled with
'pseudo_rasterization' flag. Currently it always false,
so that inserted sections are either bypassed or immediately
return from subroutines.

Changes to lib.mak only add some dependences on vdtrace.h .

In local testing the patch caused no difference with
Comparefiles (if DROPOUT_PREVENTION is 0).

If someone wants to try new code, DROPOUT_PREVENTION to be modified in gx.h .
In this case all old hacks about path adjustment are disabled,
and therefore characters render some lighter.
Visual trace may be activated with -Tf option in gs command line.
Note that it paints a big draft for any character rendered,
so you should run only simple PS files with a single character.
Also the draft scale is hardcoded in VD_SCALE constants,
so it may give an unuseful result with big character rasters.
At last please remember that visual trace window is implemented
only for Windows - other platforms will not paint anything.
The visual trace window does not implement a regeneration of painting,
therefore windows must not overlap. Run gswin32.exe with no file,
move windows and then perform 'quit' to store window layout to system Registry.

here is a simple test, which visualize improvements when
DROPOUT_PREVENTION is on :

	%!
	100 350 moveto
	/Courier findfont 2 scalefont [5 0 0 1 0 0] makefont setfont
	(/) show
	showpage

With 72dpi the old code paints nothing.
The (DROPOUT_PREVENTION=1) paints a spot.

Testing the new code with -r300 001.01.ps, the box 001-12 renders better :
no dropouts in "4", characters look better.

In gx.h I've added FILL_TRAP_WITH_SWAPPED_AXES flag. The goal is to archive
and document a dead branch of the development. I'd like to store it into
archive and then remove it in the next revision.

Two temporary configuration switches added for benchmarking purpose :

- PSEUDO_RASTERIZATION in gxfill.c disables the pseudo-rasterization
  separately from other changes.

- CONTIGUOUS_FILL disables additional checks in gdevddrw.c

Initial commit for the dropout prevention code in rasterizer.
It doesn't not change any behavior.

DETAILS:

Switching to new code is being controlled with DROPOUT_PREVENTION
macro defined in gx.h . Now it is set to "use old code".

This patch :
1. Ports the "margin" algorithm from HINTER branch.
   Now the algorithm renamed to "pseudo-rasterization".

2. Ports the dropout prevention to gx_default_fill_trapezoid from HINTER branch,
   providing a contiguous fill for slightly slanted trapezoids.

3. Adds CONNECT_RECTANGLES into gx_default_fill_trapezoid
   providing a contiguous fill for highly slanted trapezoids.

4. Fixes some problems in the "pseudo-rasterization".

5. Disables all hacks about path adjustment and oversampling
   when DROPOUT_PREVENTION is on. Those hacks were attempts
   to fix dropouts for small characters, but they do not solve
   the problem completely.

6. Provide visual trace instructions for debugging purpose.

Changes to gxpcopy.c and gxpflat.c only insert visual trace instructions for
debugging purpose. Currently all them compile to empty code.

Changes to gdevddrw.c, gxchar.c, gxtype1.c, gx.h
are protected with DROPOUT_PREVENTION. With current settings they
compile to old code.

Changes to gxfill.c are not so obvious. I was unhappy with duplicating
a thousand of lines in #if...#else...#endif. Therefore
I've inserted some dynamic checks. They are controlled with
'pseudo_rasterization' flag. Currently it always false,
so that inserted sections are either bypassed or immediately
return from subroutines.

Changes to lib.mak only add some dependences on vdtrace.h .

In local testing the patch caused no difference with
Comparefiles (if DROPOUT_PREVENTION is 0).

If someone wants to try new code, DROPOUT_PREVENTION to be modified in gx.h .
In this case all old hacks about path adjustment are disabled,
and therefore characters render some lighter.
Visual trace may be activated with -Tf option in gs command line.
Note that it paints a big draft for any character rendered,
so you should run only simple PS files with a single character.
Also the draft scale is hardcoded in VD_SCALE constants,
so it may give an unuseful result with big character rasters.
At last please remember that visual trace window is implemented
only for Windows - other platforms will not paint anything.
The visual trace window does not implement a regeneration of painting,
therefore windows must not overlap. Run gswin32.exe with no file,
move windows and then perform 'quit' to store window layout to system Registry.

here is a simple test, which visualize improvements when
DROPOUT_PREVENTION is on :

	%!
	100 350 moveto
	/Courier findfont 2 scalefont [5 0 0 1 0 0] makefont setfont
	(/) show
	showpage

With 72dpi the old code paints nothing.
The (DROPOUT_PREVENTION=1) paints a spot.

Testing the new code with -r300 001.01.ps, the box 001-12 renders better :
no dropouts in "4", characters look better.

In gx.h I've added FILL_TRAP_WITH_SWAPPED_AXES flag. The goal is to archive
and document a dead branch of the development. I'd like to store it into
archive and then remove it in the next revision.

Two temporary configuration switches added for benchmarking purpose :

- PSEUDO_RASTERIZATION in gxfill.c disables the pseudo-rasterization
  separately from other changes.

- CONTIGUOUS_FILL disables additional checks in gdevddrw.c
  separately from other changes.

With text documents performance change is almost invisible.
With Coons01.ps each of these flags give a 10% slowdown.
I guess the reason is that the code becomes too complex for
global optimization with MSVC 6.0 for Intel Pentium 3.
Other compilers/processors may give different results.

Prevent the bbox put_params from using the color mapping
functions before the device is opened.
Fixes Sourceforge bug #645531 "seg fault: bbox device + PAPERSIZE".

DETAILS:
Using "-sPAPERSIZE=a4 -sDEVICE=bbox" crashes in GS 8 when the
device parameters are being set prior to opening the bbox device.
bbox_put_params calls bbox_copy_params, gx_device_black
then the bbox encode_color which is NULL.
This is wrong because encode_color must not be called before
the device is open.  See doc/Drivers.htm#Life_cycle for details.
Prior to the DeviceN changes this did not matter because
the map_rgb_color function was valid.  Post DeviceN the
encode_color procedure is called and this is NULL until
just before the bbox device is opened.

The fix prevents bbox_copy_params from calling the
encode_color procedure while the device is closed.

Fixes SourceForge bug #651164 for customer #150.

DETAILS:

The file contains an embedded TT font subset that has a badly formatted
'post' table. This table is used to replace names in the standard encoding
for specific glyphs. The 'post' table in question maps a bunch of glyphs
that are not part of the subset to the first name in glyphnames section,
but the glyphnames section is empty. It should have at least a single byte
of 0x00 to form a zero length Pascal string.

I also added a warning that prints if the DEBUG is enabled. Since the
'postglyphs' string is automatically extended with a 0x00 byte when the
problem is detected, the warning only prints once for the font.

Handling of OpenType (OTTO) fonts with CFF fonts inside would fail if the
CFF table was not the first table in the table directory. Also stack
overflow could occur when building the FDSelect array. Now Asian fonts
sold by Adobe (as OpenType .otf fonts) can be used with Ghostscript.

DETAILS:

The initial table scanning checked the 32-bit table type against the
(CFF ) string, but then failed to skip the following 12 bytes if the table
was not CFF. Since the initial table is usually BASE, most OTTO fonts were
not usable.

Also the FDSelect array construction used the stack, so could easily
overflow if there was a largest glyph index in the font was too large. The
method used creates a 65535 element array, then fills it using the info
from the font's FDSelect info. The extra elements of the array are 'trimmed'
using getinterval.

The patch creates a stable copy of clipping path written to PDF,
and compares it when PS clip path changes.  The old comparison
is left unchanged for better performance.

Also fixes return codes from pdf_put_clip_path and
improved the initializer of gx_device_pdf.

</pre><h2><a name="8.00-Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Don't overwrite source file when ps2pdf.bat is used with 1
argument and the argument has no ".ps" extension. (Fixed by Moritz Barsnick)
Bug #631974 (lib/ps2pdfxx.bat [1.13]: 2002/11/20 03:01:23 alexcher)

</pre><h2><a name="8.00-Drivers"></a>Drivers</h2><pre>

Documents the old macos output device as deprecated. This is superceeded by
the gdevdsp. (gdevmac.c [1.7]: 2002/11/20 18:24:44 giles)

</pre><h2><a name="8.00-PDF_writer"></a>PDF writer</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Fix (pdfwrite) : pdf_put_colored_pattern wrongly accessed pattern
mask. SourceForge bugs "[ 623989 ] (pdfwrite) wrong colors with 269-01.ps",
"[ 602995 ] (pdfwrite) 269-01.ps limitcheck". (gdevpdfv.c [1.20]: 2002/11/18
22:23:40 igor)
	- Fix (pdfwrite) : Providing additional documentation about embedded
fonts. (gdevpdtb.c [1.12]: 2002/11/20 10:21:15 igor)
	- Fix (pdfwrite) : Encoding Differences were not written for
embedded Type 1,2 fonts that have a very instandard Encoding. Discovered
with SF bug "[ 641296 ] acrobat generates bad ps from gs pdf".
(gdevpdtt.c [1.24]: 2002/11/21 00:05:06 igor)
	- Fix (pdfwrite) : The previous patch about Encoding Differences was
inaccurate about True Types and CID fonts. Improving it with a better
condition. (gdevpdtt.c [1.25]: 2002/11/21 03:44:11 igor)

</pre><h2><a name="8.00-PDF_Interpreter"></a>PDF Interpreter</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Pattern stream was copied to the string failing with rangecheck
for long streams. The patch uses strings when possible and switches to
reusable streams for longer streams. Bug #634080, customer #561
(lib/pdf_draw.ps [1.63]: 2002/11/21 01:29:07 alexcher)

</pre><h2><a name="8.00-Interpreter"></a>Interpreter</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Correction for 637954 dina3_watermark.pdf fails on GS 7.33. This
forces the color space to /DeviceGray whenever the initgraphics operator is
called. Previously if color space substitution was active and the last
colorspace was /DeviceGray then its substituted colorspace would remain
active. (lib/gs_cspace.ps [1.5]: 2002/11/18 23:42:18 dan)
	- Packed array is accepted now as an encoded user path in insideness
testing operators. Bug #640855 (zupath.c [1.7]: 2002/11/20 18:17:28
alexcher)
	- Fix : (1) gc_status.requested was not initialized for stable
memories, but used by alloc_acquire_chunk. (2) setting
gc_status.vm_threshold and gc_status.enabled for stable memories
synchronously with non-stable ones. This allows to control stable memories
with setvmthreshold and vmreclaim. With default settings pdfwrite now works
faster. SourceForge bug "[ 621243 ] (pdfwrite) slow mahle.pdf"
(zvmem2.c [1.7]: 2002/11/20 18:56:56 igor)
	- Bring /SubstituteFont procedure prototype up to the standard:
&lt;name&gt; SubstituteFont &lt;name&gt; . Do traditional GS font
substitution after the standard font substitution. Use no-op standard font
substitution for backward compatibility. Bug #637424 Customer #71
(lib/gs_fonts.ps [1.24]: 2002/11/21 04:43:58 alexcher)

When processing multiple EPS files, call showpage if necessary for
subsequent files. (lib/gs_epsf.ps [1.10]: 2002/11/19 20:14:01 ghostgum)

Corrects a small typo in the api documentation. (gdevdsp.h [1.7]: 2002/11/20
17:46:26 giles)

</pre><h2><a name="8.00-Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Fix : lsb must not apply to True Type subglyphs. The offset to be
taken from composite only. SourceForge bugs "[ 623122 ] component shift in
TrueType composites", "[ 536863 ] Type11 layout bugs". (gstype42.c [1.25]:
