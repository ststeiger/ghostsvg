<p>
Before using this form, please read the <a
href="Bug-info.htm">instructions</a> for reporting problems.  If you are
using a "test" version of Ghostscript, and you are an experienced tester
(for example, if you have been testing Ghostscript since before January 1,
2000, or you have already submitted at least two problem reports that we
accepted for investigation), you can send an informal report to the place
indicated below.  Otherwise, please fill out this form completely.  Fill out
<strong>all</strong> applicable items in this form.  In particular, you
<strong>must</strong> include all data (PostScript files, PDF files,
batch/script files, and/or fonts) involved in the problem, either by giving
a URL from which we can download the data, or by including the data with the
report itself.  If you don't include this information, we can't investigate
the problem.

<p>
Please return the completed form as follows:

<ul>

<li>
If you are reporting a problem in a public, tested release of Aladdin
Ghostscript, and you do not need to attach any files to the report, go to <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=1897">
http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=1897</a>and follow the
instructions there.  Use the completed problem reporting form as the body of
the Bug Tracker submission.

<li>
Otherwise (i.e., if you are reporting a problem in a "test" fileset, or you
need to attach files to the report), e-mail the form, with any attached
files, to one of the following addresses depending on the platform:

<ul>

<li>For MS-DOS, MS Windows, or OS/2, <a
href="mailto:bug-gswin@aladdin.com">bug-gswin@aladdin.com</a>.

<li>For MacOS, <a
href="mailto:bug-mac-gs@aladdin.com">bug-mac-gs@aladdin.com</a>.

<li>For all other platforms, <a
href="mailto:bug-gs@aladdin.com">bug-gs@aladdin.com</a>.

</ul>

</ul>

advance.
