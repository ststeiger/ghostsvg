</pre><h2><a name="6.62-Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Minor changes to fix compilation on VMS, thanks to Jacob
=JoukJansen for the patch. (devs.mak [1.42]: 2001/03/01 22:16:02 raph)
	- Corrects whitespace for new entries in devs.mak for VMS build.
Thanks to Jouk Jansen. (devs.mak [1.44]: 2001/03/13 20:01:35 raph)
	- Fixes SourceForge bug #219677. Adds debug and debugclean targets
to MSVC++ makefile that build in the debugobj and debugbin directories.
Fixes BEGINFILES and BEGINFILES2 so that 'make clean' removes all files.
(msvc32.mak [1.10], winlib.mak [1.7]: 2001/03/16 22:53:18 ghostgum)
	- /None and /All separations are now supported. SourceForge bug
#228354. (lib.mak [1.45]: 2001/03/18 19:15:50 igorm)
	- Adds lib directory to MS-Windows distribution archive. Change
copyright message in MS-Windows setup program to artofcode LLC. Thanks to
Russell Lang for the patch. (winint.mak [1.7]: 2001/03/19 17:12:45 raph)

Increments version number to 6.62 as part of 6.61 release process.
(version.mak [1.27]: 2001/02/24 01:56:01 raph)

Provide alternate %stdin/out/err implementation using procedure based
streams and callouts. Previous stdio implementation with
STDIO_IMPLEMENTATION= New callout stdio implementation with
STDIO_IMPLEMENTATION=c Bug fix to zflush and zpeekstring. New stdio stream
code is in ziodevsc.c which will be in next commit. (bcwin32.mak [1.5],

enhanced imaging operations. (int.mak [1.44], lib.mak [1.43]: 2001/03/13
00:41:10 raph)

Implement new Ghostscript interpreter API for DLL or shared object.
Reimplement old DLL interface using new API. See iapi.h and iapi.c for new
API. For unix, build using "make so". Added loader programs for Ghostscript
interpreter library for Linux (dxmain.c), Windows (dw*.c) and OS/2
(dpmain.c). Add new "display" device for use with the new API. Linux
dxmain.c uses the "display" device, Gtk+ and GdkRgb for faster drawing than
the "x11" device. (devs.mak [1.43], gsdll2.def [1.2], gsdll32.def [1.2],

unix-gcc.mak [1.11], winint.mak [1.6], winlib.mak [1.6]: 2001/03/13 07:09:28
ghostgum)

When building the Linux shared object, separate directories soobj and sobin
are used to prevent 'make' from mixing the object files and building a
corrupt executable. Added 'API.htm' to the installed documentation files.
(unix-dll.mak [1.2], unix-gcc.mak [1.12], unixinst.mak [1.18]: 2001/03/15
09:11:28 ghostgum)

Change AFPL Ghostscript path on Windows and OS/2 platforms from c:/aladdin
to c:/gs. (bcwin32.mak [1.6], msvc32.mak [1.9], msvclib.mak [1.8],

slightly modified version of icclib (icc.h, icc.c, icc9809.h) by Graeme
Gill. (bcwin32.mak [1.7], devs.mak [1.45], dvx-gcc.mak [1.7], gs.mak [1.4],

Cleanup of MS-Windows and OS/2 code. Remove old 16-bit MS-Windows code.

Fixes problems:
	- to achieve page independence, every page must in the general case
set page parameters. To preserve duplexing the page cannot set page
parameters. New code checks the current page size and sets it only if it is
necessary. Bug #404376 reported by bannis at users.sourceforge.net
(gdevpsu.c [1.3]: 2001/03/03 03:27:03 alexcher)

Redirect all user messages from stdout and stderr to outwrite() and

Fixes problems:
	- When the stream is located in an external file (i.e. the stream
dictionary contains an /F entry) GS fails with "typecheck in .knownget"
because of a minor bug in stack handling in pdf_base.ps. Bug #229425, the
fix from Andreas Bolsch &lt;meromorphic at users.sourceforge.net&gt;
(lib/pdf_base.ps [1.13]: 2001/03/04 16:59:19 alexcher)
	- GS can override image interpolation using INTERPOLATE or
NOINTERPOLATE flags. These flags had no effect on PDF because the PDF
interpreter is bound earlier than image operator is redefined. New version
takes image and imagemask values from systemdict at run time.
(lib/pdf_draw.ps [1.27]: 2001/03/11 05:15:26 alexcher)

Fixes problems:
	- Allocate filter in local VM when currentglobal is false. Prevents
a problem with some QuarkXpress ProcSets that turn off vmreclaim and expect
save/restore to free memory which only works on local VM. Fix for problem
reported by Artifex customer #150, file "japan.ps". (zfilter.c [1.5]:
2001/02/28 00:39:26 rayjj)
	- Speed-up JPEG decompression by increasing file buffer to 2K. This
avoids installation of an intermediate buffering filter that resulted in a
byte-by-byte filling of the buffer to the JPEG code. When the buffer was not
full enough a recoverable error would result in a round trip for the next
byte. Fixes SourcForge bug #405342 for Artifex customer #350.
(zfile.c [1.7]: 2001/03/02 03:06:50 alexcher)
	- Removes Category dictionary from dictionary stack during the

This fix corrects a problem with VM usage in the DSC parser. Previously the
dictionary dsc_dict was allocated in global VM but the DSC parser would try
to insert items while in local VM mode. This fix forces the DSC parser into

Integrates ICC profile input support from Jan Stoeckenius. Also includes
slightly modified version of icclib (icc.h, icc.c, icc9809.h) by Graeme
Gill. (icie.h [1.3], lib/gs_icc.ps [1.1], zcie.c [1.5], zicc.c [1.1]:

</pre><h2><a name="6.62-Streams"></a>Streams</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- eexecDecode filter returned EOF immediately if the input stream
was shorter than 9 characters. New code may misidentify short streams but
old code always failed. (seexec.c [1.4]: 2001/02/23 03:00:13 alexcher)

Replace many references to exit() with returns. (stdpre.h [1.3]: 2001/03/12
03:50:02 ghostgum)

Redirect all user messages from stdout and stderr to outwrite() and
errwrite(). This is needed to allow stdout/err to be redirected to the
caller for DLL / shared object builds. (std.h [1.4]: 2001/03/13 06:51:39

Minor patch to header files so that unlink() prototype doesn't conflict when
const is disabled through #define. (stdio_.h [1.4]: 2001/03/17 01:18:34
raph)

</pre><h2><a name="6.62-Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Minor changes to fix compilation on VMS, thanks to Jacob
=JoukJansen for the patch. (gstrans.c [1.13]: 2001/03/01 22:16:02 raph)
	- gp_file_name_sizeof is increased to 260 bytes, == MAX_PATH on MS
Windows. The platform-specific fix is too difficult because some platforms
may have very long or unlimited file names. Bug #231514 submitted by
anonymous user. (gp.h [1.6]: 2001/03/03 04:38:19 alexcher)
	- When objects were resized or trimmed, the objects o_size was not
being updated if the rounded_size didn't change. This could lead to
alignment issues on some systems (causing a crash). Problem reported by
Artifex customer #460. (gsalloc.c [1.9]: 2001/03/12 00:04:28 rayjj)
	- Some device color components were missed while serializing
halftone to clist, causing segment fault during playback. Changes use proper
number of device color components to be written to clist and read from it.
SourceForge bug #211449. (gxclpath.c [1.9], gxclrast.c [1.9]: 2001/03/13
08:38:03 igorm)
	- kshow now restores currentfont if changed while running proc.
Fixes SourceForge bug #221715. (gxchar.c [1.3]: 2001/03/14 13:03:49 igorm)
	- properly include unistd_.h in files that call unlink()
(gsiodev.c [1.5], gxclfile.c [1.3]: 2001/03/16 22:12:34 giles)
	- /None and /All separations are now supported. SourceForge bug
#228354. (gscsepr.c [1.7]: 2001/03/18 19:17:50 igorm)

Replace many references to exit() with returns. (gsargs.c [1.3],
gsargs.h [1.4], gsexit.h [1.3], gxalloc.h [1.6]: 2001/03/12 03:50:02

Adds device filter pipeline, which will be used by PDF 1.4 and other
enhanced imaging operations. (gsdfilt.c [1.1], gsdfilt.h [1.1],
gsstate.c [1.10], gzstate.h [1.5]: 2001/03/13 00:41:10 raph)

Implement new Ghostscript interpreter API for DLL or shared object.
Reimplement old DLL interface using new API. See iapi.h and iapi.c for new
API. For unix, build using "make so". Added loader programs for Ghostscript
interpreter library for Linux (dxmain.c), Windows (dw*.c) and OS/2
(dpmain.c). Add new "display" device for use with the new API. Linux
dxmain.c uses the "display" device, Gtk+ and GdkRgb for faster drawing than
the "x11" device. (gsexit.h [1.4]: 2001/03/13 07:09:29 ghostgum)

Moves patched icclib 1.23 files into the new icclib/ subdirectory, with
makefile changes to match. Adds missing COPYRIGHT and other documentation to
icclib. Thanks to L. Peter Deutsch for pointing out the need. (icc.h [1.2]:

Cleanup of MS-Windows and OS/2 code. Remove old 16-bit MS-Windows code.
Remove references to stdout/err, replacing with eprintf(). Remove global
