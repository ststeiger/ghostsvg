Fix (pdfwrite) : Merge the Encoding of the 'complete' font copy when merging fonts.

DETAILS :

"PPI-ProPag 2.6.1.4 (archivePg)" creates multiple font copies with reduced encodings
(we believe it is poorly designed), and we merge the copies back to a single font.
Doing so the Encoding was not merged for the "complete" font copy.
The patch fixes that.

Fix (pdfwrite) : 'loca' was wrong in some cases embedding a TT font subset.

DETAILS :

By TT spec, when a TT font uses indexToLocFormat==0, glyph offsets in 'glyf' must be even.
The old code doesn't take care about the glyph alignment while converting a font
from indexToLocFormat==1 to indexToLocFormat==0.
This patch inserts padding bytes into 'glyf' to align glyph offsets with indexToLocFormat==0.

<blockquote><pre>
1.  Ignore data after %%EOF whicl scanning for objects or trailer.
2.  Allow objects with duplicate object and generation numbers.
3.  Change heuristic for finding the trailer dictionary.

DETAILS:

The previous testing had on the rebuild facility had verified that
all test files ran without apparent problems.  However a full check
of the files in the regression test suite has found three cases of
the output images not matching between the normal PDF processing
and the rebuild processing.

1.  Many real life PDF files contain garbage after the final %%EOF
marker.  Ghostscript has known about and tolerated this situation for
some time.  I found a test case (adesso6.pdf) in which the repair
logic was finding what it considered a valid object in this garbage.
The revisions determine the location of the last %%EOF and form a
count of the data left in the file after the %%EOF.  This count is
used to exclude this data from the object scanning and the trailer
location scanning.

2.  A test case was found in which two objects were found to have
the same object number and revision number.  By my reading of the
PDF spec, the newer object should have a higher revision number.
However the object scanner was changed to accept the last such
object as the desired one.  Most PDF editors (at least Adobe) put
updated objects at the end of the file.

3.  A test case was found in which a Linearized PDF file had been
edited and a new xref list and trailer dictionary were placed at
the end of the file.  The heuristic for finding the trailer dictionary
was changed to check the specified location of the 'first' xref list.
If this location is in the first half of the file, then the start of
the file is searched for the first trailer.  Otherwise the end of the
file is searched for the last trailer.

With these three changes, all of the PDF files in the regression
test suite produce matching results using either the normal PDF
processing or the rebuild procedures.

<blockquote><pre>
The TrueType font loading was quite a bit slower than it should be. This
optimized font loader is up to ten times faster. Fixes bug #686851.

DETAILS:

Analysis of the time spent during TT font loading led to two problem areas.

The first was that the cmap array was built inefficiently when their was
a large glyph range, that had large holes was built with a loop that
called a PostScript function 'putglyph' to fill unused areas with .notdef
(glyph ID 0). The revision pre-fills the 'glyphs' array with .notdef from
a static array pre-filled with 1024 zeroes.

The second problem was the code that built the encoding using the 'post'
table. This code had a 'repeat' loop to find the name from the start of
the glyphNames section of the 'post' table for each named glyph in the
encoding. By creating a temporary cross reference, only one pass through
the names is made.

<blockquote><pre>
Correct the implementation of the new file_name_combine operators for MacOS.

Details:

The parent directory reference prefix is '::' rather than ':'. Also, a path
that begins with the ':' directory separator is a relative path from the
current working directory.

The more substantive change is in the implementation on gp_check_root(), intended
to return the 'root' prefix of a path, if any. The previous implementation returned
the location of the first patch separator, causing initialization to fail when
attempting to determine if GenericResourceDir ends in a directory separator in
gs_res.c.

Absolute paths are not a well defined concept on Classic MacOS. In that case we just
return 0, as if no path were ever absolute. This likely causes other problems not
addressed here. In the Carbon build, we make use of the FSGetVolumeInfo() call
to enumerate all mounted volumes, attempting to match each one. This call returns a
16-bit char unicode name for each volume which we make no attempt to convert to
whatever 8-bit encoding ghostscript might receive the path in orginally; however
we do match the lower 8 bits for the first 256 characters, which works well enough
for English volume names.

Note that this patch only provides support for MacOS-style paths with ':' as a
separator. The Metrowerks Standard Library also accepts unix-style paths and
on MacOS X users will expect to be able to use them. Support will need to be
extended to include this.

<blockquote><pre>
This is a set of routines for attempting to recover PDF files which
have been mangled by EOL conversions.  This is a facility which Adobe
Acrobat has and thus we need to duplicate.

DETAILS:

THE PROBLEM:

The basic problem is that PDF files contain 'xref tables' which are
really object location indexes which contain the absolute position of
objects in a file.  If a file is changed by converting the type of
EOLs then the file size is changed and the xref data is no longer
valid.  In many cases, Acrobat can rebuild these files.  It is not
always possible to always rebuild files.  If the files contain binary
data which contains line feed or new line characters then the binary
data may be mangled and cannot be rebuilt.  We need to be able to
duplicate Acrobat's ability for rebuilding files.  (Note:  In theory
one can get more and more sophisticated about rebuilding files.  The
techniques used in this code are quite simple but effective.)

THE BASIC SOLUTION:

The solution to this problem consists of several pieces.  The first piece
was to modify the pdf interpreter's internal representation of the xref
data.  The xref data is stored into two larrays.  The larray Generations
contains the object's generation number.  This was not changed.  The
larray Objects contained the location of the xref entry in the file.
This was set initially by the readxref routine.  Since the xref entry
data is not valid (for mangled files) this was not useful.  Objects
was changed to contain the actual location of the object in the file.
This actually eliminates one step in the process.  Previously when an
object was referenced, the location of the xref entry in the file was
obtained from Objects and then the xref entry was read to determine
the actual location of the desired object.

The second part of the process was to put .internal_stopped trapping
around the two usages of readxref to catch any failures of that routine.
An error message is printed and we then try to rebuild the locations
of the objects and find the proper trailer dictionary.

The third part of the process is to locate the objects in the file.
This is done by a simple scan of the file looking for lines beginning
with x y obj where x is a object number and y is object generation
number and obj is the text 'obj'.  In theory this simple strategy can
be confused by binary data but with over 156 files tested, no problems
were found.

The fourth part of the process is to locate the appropriate 'trailer'
dictionary.  There is a trailer dictionary with each xref list.  In
theory there can be many trailer dictionaries in a file.  The only
desired trailer dictionary is the one associated with the 'first'
xref list.  Unfortunately since we cannot count on the location
information in a mangled file, following the xref links is problematic.
The solution used is simple.  For Linearized pdf files, we find the
first (at the front of the file) trailer dictionary otherwise we use
the last trailer dictionary in the file.  This simple method works
for the 151 known good files (see testing below) and all five known
bad files.

Included are diffs for the changes and the new file lib/pdf_rbld.ps.
The only change in the src directory was the addition of pdf_rbld.ps
to the int.mak file.

TESTING:

There have been two sets of test run on this code.  The first set
consists of running 151 pdf files from our regression test suite.
These files are not mangled.  However by disabling the normal readxref
routine, the new code was exercised.  All 151 pdf files were displayed
correctly.

The second set of tests consists of actual problem files.  I was able
to locate five files that we have been sent that have been mangled.

file name		Ghostscript	Acrobat 5.0.5
1003.pdf		   okay		   okay
cm_test.pdf		   okay		   okay
precon.pdf		   okay	  	   fail
ServletReport.pdf	   fail	       	   fail
dauben.pdf		   fail		   fail

As expected, not all files can be recovered.  I was pleased that,
for this small sample, we did better than Acrobat.

Revised fix for 686872 token operator sometimes leaves extra data on stack.
With some strings, the token operator can leave extra data on the stack.
In the test case, the token operator is generating a syntaxerror.  The
error is expected.  However the token operator is leaving 3 items on the
stack.  It should only leave one:  The original string.  This fix
corrects the problem.

DETAILS:

The problem was found while developing the xref data recovery facility
which uses the token operator to scan PDF files (including binary data).
The fix consists of simply recording the operator stack level at the
start of the string processing and restoring it if an error occurs.

The revision to the fix consists of using the 'pop' macro to modify
the o_stack pointer instead of directly setting the pointer.

For the pngalpha device, set the default background color to white
in the bKGD chunk.  Add an option -dBackgroundColor=16#RRGGBB to
explicitly set the background color.  This is needed by a common
web browser that doesn't correctly support PNG with alpha transparency.

DETAILS:
Programs that don't fully support alpha transparency let
libpng convert an RGBA image to RGB.  The background color
used is either provided by the program, or in the bKGD
chunk, or it falls back to gray.  MSIE was defaulting
to a gray background which is not commonly used on web
pages.  By writing a white bKGD chunk, PNG files will display
correctly against a white background in MSIE.
If a solid color for a web page background is used
with <body bgcolor="#CCCC00">, then PNG images appearing
on that page would need to be created with
-dBackgroundColor=16#CCCC00.
For textured background there is no hope.

If reopening the display device fails after setting the

bitmap using a low level allocator to avoid exceeding the memory
limit of the previously used device stable memory allocator.
Fixes bugs 686836 "-r doesn't work" and duplicate 686838
"Ghostscript doesn't do anything".

DETAILS:
The display memory device and the raster including line pointers
was allocated using the stable allocator of the display device.
This had a limit of 1Mbyte, which was exceeded when the
resolution was greater then 114dpi.  This would cause subsequent
allocations to fail, but it appears that nothing else tried to
use this allocator after the display device.  The display device
was changed to allocate the line pointers separately to allow
the raster to be allocated in special memory, e.g. video memory
or shared memory.  This caused the subsequent allocation of the
line pointers to fail when resolution exceeded 114dpi.

The modified code now allocates the raster with
gs_alloc_byte_array_immovable, which allocates directly from the
C heap, not subject to any memory limit apart from the overall
-K limit if specified, and is not subject to garbage collection.
The normal allocator now has sufficient memory to allocate the
line pointers without problem. The raster pointer is removed
from the pointers that are enumerated during garbage collection.

Log Message:

This is the fix for 686798 /typecheck in --setcolorspace-- with
-sDEVICE=x11cmyk. This fix increases the stack checking while sampling
tint transform functions. It also makes the error handling more robust
for invalid tint transforms.

DETAILS:

It is sad to say but this is a bug that we have seen before, several
times.  Ray and I fixed this problem at the last code fest in September.
However that fix did not make its way into CVS.

The cause of this problem is that certain proc sets from Adobe violate
the PLRM.  In the test file, the proc set is from Adobe Photoshop
Version 5.5.  The proce set contains tint transform functions which
violate the specification in two different ways.  In one case, the tint
transform function changes stack values outside of the given color value.
This is used as a test to see if the interpreter supports the given
duotone color space.  If so then the proc set creates a color space with
a tint transform which is unbalanced in its stack usage.  This could
cause a stack overflow/underflow during sampling of the tint transform.
Adobe apparently assumes that this tint transform is never executed
since the function starts with the name /NeverReached.

The fix involves checking the stack depth after each execution of the
tint transform function and verifying that it matches the correct
position given the number of function inputs and outputs.  If so then
the stack is returned to its original position and the sampling is
aborted.  Changes in lib/gs_sepr.ps make the tint transform sampling
logic more robust in case the tint transform modifies the top of the
stack.  (This occurs in this case since the tint transform is actually
popping extra items off of the stack.)  We also create a dummy tint
transform function if sampling fails.  The later was done to prevent
the /typecheck error and give pdfwrite something with which to work.

A preparation for non-convert PatternType 1 to rasters with pdfwrite.

DETAILS:

The patch defines a new device virtual function pattern_manage,
and a default implementation for it. The purpose is to inform
the device about pattern accumulation and to bypass the installation of
gx_device_pattern_accum when the device can handle the pattern command stream.

The new code is temporary disabled with PATTERN_STREAM_ACCUMULATION 0
macro defined in gx.h . When it is 0, the new device virtual
function is provided but never called. The behavior should not change.

The rest of this log message describes PATTERN_STREAM_ACCUMULATION 1.
In this mode pdfwrite doesn't convert PatternType 1 to rasters.
It creates good PDFs at least with 012-09.ps and 269-01.ps
(these are very complicated cases with patterns inside charprocs and patterns),
but there are problems when rasterizing the resulting PDFs with GS.
(A new bug 686834 issued for tracking this problem).

When a pattern stream is handled by the device,
we can't create a proper content of gx_color_tile.
However we need a correct content if the pattern is used
for rasterization of an object which the device can't handle
at the high level. An example is pdf14 device during a PDF re-distillation,
which handles transparency. Another example is
a conversion of composite fonts, which have multiple CID descendents -
pdfwrite still converts such fonts to raster fonts.

Since a proper contents may be needed for gx_device_color,
we define a new flag gx_color_tile::is_dummy, and account it in
gx_pattern_cache_lookup. Thus, if the current device is cache device
installed for the font conversion, the tiles with is_dummy == true
are being be dismissed. Vice versa, tiles with is_dummy == false are
being dismissed when current device is pdfwrite.

We do not move parts of zpcolor.c code to gx_default_pattern_manage,
because we don't see a proper place for it to be compatible to
the FEATURE_DEVS configurability. Instead that, we implement
a branching inside gsptype1.c and zpcolor.c . If more branches will
be necessary in future, this to be improved with moving code
fragments to specific implementations of pattern_manage,
together with improving the FEATURE_DEVS modularity.
Delaying this reorganization until a strong reason appears.

NOTE: The patch extends the device interface with gs_pattern1_instance_t.

Minor Changes :

1. Fixed some MSVC warnings.
2. gx_pattern_alloc_cache passed a wrong client ID to memory manager.
3. Skipped some unuseful graphic state parameters while a contents substream accumulation.

DETAILS :

Since the revision 1.9 of gdevpdtb.c (Sun Sep 8 20:20:12 2002 UTC)
subset font names were deterministic to simplify the debugging.
The names were derived from resource IDs, and could cause a conflict
when merging documents. This patch generates different font names
hashing the glyph usage bitmask. Now the conflict can happen
with a very small probablility, when different subsets give same

<blockquote><pre>
Switching to the new logics of resource file location.
THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, because the default resource path is now different :
resource files are moved to gs/Resource .
See gs/doc/Use.htm#Finding_files and gs/doc/Use.htm#Resource_related_parameters.

DETAILS:

This patch does not include necessary changes to Ghostscript installer.

The main code change in one to gp.h .
Rudiments of old code in gs/src and gs/lib are marked with NEW_COMBINE_PATH.
They to be removed after beta-testing.

Change to makefiles provide extended default values for
file search paths, which are platform dependent.

For convenience, here we summarize all related issues,
which were mentioned in previous patches :

1. The search method with multiple resource directories
   appears not fully conforming to PLRM. We cannot ever call
   ResourceFileName while executing findresource
   or resourcestatus, because per PLRM it always
   returns a single path. Therefore we implement
   an extended search method in findresource,
   resourcestatus and resourceforall, which first calls
   ResourceFileName and checks whether the returned path
   points to an existing file. If yes, the file is used,
   othervise we search all directories specified in
   LIB_PATH. With a single resource directory
   it appears equivalent to Adobe.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

2. ResourceFileName may be used for obtaining a path
   where a resource file to be installed. In this case
   Ghostscript to be invoked with -sGenericResourceDir=path,
   specifying an absolute path. The default value for
   GenericResourceDir is a relative path. Therefore
   a default invocation with a Postscript installer
   will install resources into gs/Resource.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

3. We do not distinguish lib and Resource directories.
   There is no file name conflicts because
   lib does not contain subdirectories, but Resource
   always store files in subdirectories.

4. We implement a new flag in gs_context_state,
   which informs lib_file_open whether it is invoked
   with a file specified in a command line argument.
   Doing so because command line argument files
   don't need to check permissions, and they
   are executed with a special PS operator .runfile .
   We cannot use a .runfile argument for passing this
   information, because it would be a security hole
   due to .runfile is available for documents
   and cannot be hidden.

5. We still have a security hole while loading
   resources from gs_init.ps .
   Both the old and the new code load some resources
   (such as CIDInit ProcSet) before entering
   the SAFER mode. Therefore it is a way for
   Postscript viruses to migrate.
   To be fixed later.

6. Default values for GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir
   are platform dependent.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).

7. Default value for GenericResourcePathSep is platform dependent.
   The value is used before non-directory items only.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).
   (The old code used the value before directory items - a bug on OpenVMS).

8. If a path starts with a number of parent references,
   a template with same number of parent references
   must be added to permission list to allow the access in SAFER mode.
   The template (*) allows access to any file.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, because
   the old code ever rejects parent directories.

9. GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir are not being added
   to permission list while .locksafe. Instead that,
   we generate (*/*) templates with all LIBPATH items.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, but for non-exotic cases
   (such as "(./Resource/CMap/H) .libfile" in a document)
   it should not be visible.

A. Scratch files with a non-absolute prefix always open
   in a scratch directory. The old code can open them
   in current and parent directories if an user modified
   a default prefix in C code.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE for users who had modified
   a scratch file prefix in C code.
   Permission for scratch directory is not checked
   as well as in old code.

B. The operator .filenamedirseparator is removed,
   because it cannot work properly on OpenVMS.
   On OpenVMS it needs both prefix and trailer to
   determine a correct separator.
   We removed it because the new logics never needs it.

C. The operator .pathstring_not_bare is removed,
   because .file_name_combine performs it's job better.

D. The functions gp_pathstring_not_bare, gp_file_name_references_parent,
   char *gp_file_name_concat_string are removed.

E. New operators added to maintain the new logics :

   <string> <string> <bool> .file_name_combine <string> true
   <string> <string> <bool> .file_name_combine <string> <string> false

      Combine a file name with a prefix.
      The first argument is a prefix, the second is a file name.
      Internal syntax of arguments and result is platform dependent.
      The combination is being reduced to a shortest equivalent,
      but if it starts with cwd reference, the starting
      cwd reference persists.

      If the <bool> argument is true, it considered to use the
      "no sibling" mode. It prevents reduction of
      (x/../y) to (y) for any x != y. With false such reduction
      is allowed. The <bool> argument appears a rudinemt from
      a dead branch. The new code always sets it to false.

      On success, the result is a combined, reduced path and false.
      On failure, the argument strings left on operand stack,
      followed with false.

   - .file_name_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between directory item and file item.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourcePathSep.

   - .file_name_directory_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between two directory items.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourceDir
      and FontResourceDir.

   - .file_name_current <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a reference
      to current working directory. Used for making the default
      value of GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir.

DETAILS:
Windows API documentation seems to imply undefined results when seeking
of retrieving file position of a special file. MSDN documentation requires
programmers to check file type using GetFileType() function before seeking.
MSVC 6 CRTL doesn't check file type before calling the corresponding 
Windows API functions. fstat() is the only function in MSVC 6 CRTL that
calls GetFileType(). S_ISREG() is a POSIX macro that check whether the

Add news script to generate split abbreviated/detailed changelogs in the new
format. Accepts xml input from the cvs2cl perl script.

DETAILS:

After the 8.00 release we switched to a new format for Changes.htm and the
History files, based on the more traditional Changelog format instead of
grouping commits by section, which often resulted in duplicate posts. At
the same time we began a convention of including any notes too extensive
for such a listing below a 'DETAILS:' separator, with the idea that we'd
create two changelogs, with hyperlinks between so detailed information was
still available even in the new easier to browse format.

The method we've adopted uses the cvs2cl perl script, available from
http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/ to parse the output of 'cvs log' and
generate an xml file containing the merged entries. This script is
more robust than our own cvs2hist. The split_changelog.py script is
then run to convert the xml changelog to the two sizes of linked html
changelogs.

split_changelog isn't very bright about constructing links, so it should
be run from inside the doc directory for now.

pdfwrite : Don't convert Type 3 fonts to raster fonts.

DETAILS :

The main work is done with pdf_install_charproc_accum and
pdf_end_charproc_accum. They forward a BuildChar/BuildGlyph output
to a separate graphic stream. See the big comment at the end of pdf_text_process.

The new function gx_default_text_restore_state restores graphic
state of PS interpreter when we discontinue the default text enumeration
after executing a PS charproc. New state variable gx_device_pdf::accum_char_proc
sets a special mode for graphic handlers.

We ever clip BuildChar/BuildGlyph with a FontBBox or with character bbox
specified in setcachedevice*. Doing so with calling gx_clip_to_rectangle
from pdf_text_set_cache, because we need to avoid the
current PS clipping path to interfere the character proc.
Possibly a better way is to install an infinite (i.e. absenting) clipping box,
wnen setcharwidth is used instead setcachedevice*.
but we don't know how to. Due to that the distilled 238-01.ps
renders some differently than undistilled one, and in most cases
it appears closer to what CPSI does.

An additional optimization : In sync_text_state the condition for matrix
sinchronization is done weaker : with empty text buffer the

Remove the non-HAVE_STDINT_H non-win32 attempts to define stdint types
and related sys/types redefine hacks. Also warn in the configure script
if stdint.h is not found.

DETAILS:

Compiling libjbig2dec requires the size-specific types in stdint.h, as
does compiling in the headers. Therefore these types must be made
available in ghostscript if jbig2.dev is included in FEATURE_DEVS.

The best way to integrate this is to create a stdint_.h for ghostscript
that contains discovered and/or platform-specific typedefs for the
types. This is still the plan, but to speed integration we just through
some defines into stdpre.h. If -DHAVE_CONFIG_H is passed by the makefile
(as configure does) then the C99 header is used, and we make specific
defines for MSVC which doesn't yet ship the header. We also had some
fallbacks for other systems (vendor unix mostly) but these caused
collisions with partial definitions of what became the C99 types in
sys/types.h and the redirection hack we do with ulong et al. did not
work on all platforms (notably macosx).

It is the fallback defines that have been removed; users building
on older platforms will probably have to patch the types in to use JBIG2
support.

pdfwrite : The old code copied parameters of PS interpreter's graphic state
to the output PDF. However some of them are installation dependent and must not copy.
THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE : the generated PDFs will render some differently
on printers.

DETAILS:

We provide a signal to pdfwrite at very end of gs_init.ps - see
the change to gs_pdfwr.ps, the priority=2000.
The signal is handled in gdev_pdf_fill_path,
and stores a copy of PS interpreter's graphic state parameter values.
Those valuess are used for comparizon with current parameters of PS interpreter
when an object is written. Therefore, if a value of a parameter was not
changed by a document, it is not written to PDF.

Note that if a PS document sets parameters equal to the
installation defaults, the setting in missed in PDF.
This is unfortunate.

The patch causes multiple differences in rendering distilled
comparefiles with pkmraw, because transfer functions changed from a
HP-specific (defined in gs_init.ps) to none. Those differences were
checked with the fuzzy compare utility and look fine. It should fix
the 2003-03-26 regressions, but new differences will appear.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Provide a complete monitoring of the viewer's graphic state
while generating a PDF output. The old code misses the synchronization
of the viewer's graphic state with its internal copy when generating
a 'grestore' command to undo a clipping.
Bug 686763 "pdfwrite is not correctly handling OPM distiller parameter".

DETAILS :

This change affects all vector devices, but it should be equivalent
for all them except pdfwrite, and except for the pointer lifetime bug
explained below.

Here is an example when the desynchronization appears :

  f1 settransfer
  0 setcolor
  path1 fill
  f2 settransfer
  1 setcolor
  path2 fill
  gsave
  path3 clip
  path4 fill
  grestore
  path5 fill

After 'grestore' it uses f1 instead f2.

The old code does not remember the viewer's graphic state,
which was immediately before 'gsave', and resets the internal copy of
the graphic state to default values when it generates 'grestore'.
This logic is fully wrong : if after 'grestore' a parameter is equal
to the default value, pdfwrite does not generate a set command for this parameter,
but the viewer uses the value which was set before 'grestore',
which can differ from the default one.

Moreover, gdevvec copies the device color from local memory
to global memory, and doesn't ask garbager to process pointers in
the copy. When the device color contains pointers
to patterns or so, the live time of the copy appears bigger
than the live time of the pointed structure. The old code only
compares the pointed addresses without accessing the pointed data,
so that a crash can't happen. But if garbager moves another color
to same address, the comparison answers "equal" when actually colors
are not equal, and the generated PDF appears wrong.

To exclude the pointer lifetime problem, the patch uses the 'save_dc' method
instead the 'equal' method for colors. But the implementation
of save_dc was dummy for patterns. To complete it, gs_id is
inserted into gs_pattern_instance_s, and more variants added to
gx_device_color_saved_s. The clist device appears tolerant
to this change.

Note that macros color_unset, color_set_null, color_is_null,
gx_dc_is_null are now applied to gx_device_color_saved.

For complete monitoring the viewer's graphic state,
we implement a 2-elements stack 'vgstack' in gx_device_pdf_s,
save the viewer's graphic state in it when generating 'q' commands,
and restore from there when generating 'Q'. If a 'gs' parameter
needs to change, we move to 'PDF_IN_STREAM' context, because
we must not insert 'gs' into a text context. New functions
pdf_try_prepare_stroke and pdf_try_prepare_fill provide
the "try" logics for this.

If a 'gs' parameter changes with changing a clipping,
first we need to undo the old clipping with 'Q',
and then generate new 'gs' parameters relatively to the
restored graphic state. The new function pdf_unclip
works for this.

With this patch the length of generated PDF appears longer
for some tests. The most important ones are :

acrobat.pdf        Lengths differ in 6141.
adesso8.pdf        Lengths differ in -8316.
HeiseiMinStd.pdf   Lengths differ in 4000.
narrow_font.pdf    Lengths differ in 6141.
RealCities.pdf     Lengths differ in 12370.
RodinCIDEmbed.pdf  Lengths differ in 101698.

It happens because pdfwrite doesn't remember 'gs' dictionaries,
and therefore redundant copies can appear.
This problem to be fixed separately.

Expecting a progression : 093-01.ps (was a wrong stroke widths with a PaintType 2 font).

Expecting a regression : with this patch, re-distilled
    Testform.v1.0.2.pdf paints good with Adobe, but wrongly with GS.
                         Maybe a bug in GS PDF interpreter.

of the previous patch is fully wrong. The CID font in the test document
for 686759 does not contain cmap and the cmap must not
be written. But with the previous patch a corrupt cmap
was written. Accessing the wrong font copy pdfwrite
failed to compute glyph widths and therefore converted the font
into a bitmap font. This patch restores the code
to "have_cmap = no_generate,". The bug 686759 is reopened.

Also we detected that the OS/2 table was written
wrongly in some circumstances : its position in font

DETAILS
Add missing initialiser for get_clipping_box to
prn_color_params_procs macro.  (src/gdevprn.h)

Avoid cast warning for software_key (src/gdevpng.c).

Add pngalpha device that uses RGBA.  This requires custom
encode_color and decode_color procedures to put RGB in the
first three bytes while leaving the fourth A byte as opaque.
To avoid gx_no_color_value, the alpha is stored inverted so
opaque is 0x00 and transparent is 0xff.

If pngalpha is told to fill the entire page with white, it uses
the kludge of instead filling with almost white and transparent
(0xfefefeff). This works because it is triggered by "erasepage",
but not by "1 setgray clippath fill". A custom open_device and
put_params are needed to save the clist or memory device
fill_rectangle, and to restore the pngalpha_fill_rectangle.

A custom copy_alpha is required to correctly blend RGBA. The
blend is based on pixel coverage, not true transparency
Ghostscript doesn't pass transparency to the device. Alpha blend
maths from Porter and Duff 1984 paper for "A over B". RGB values
are stored without pre-multiplication. A custom
pngalpha_create_buf_device is used to replace the memory device
implementation gx_default_copy_alpha with pngalpha_copy_alpha,
but not to replace clist_copy_alpha.

The pngalpha device is successful at giving a transparent
background to many images such as colorcir.ps and golfer.eps,
but not tiger.eps which fills the clipping path with grey.

"0 setcachelimit" before rendering a glyph).
But it is not compatible to CPSI (a special test done).
Providing a correct restore appears too complicated -
need to change the data representation to 'ref'.

file_name_combine : (1) Implement the extended search method in resourceforall,
resourcestatus, ResourceFileName. (2) Don't check permissions for command line argument files.

DETAILS:

This patch does not change any behavior with a regular build.

To skip the permission check with argument files we added a flag into
gs_context_state. This is only a secure way to pass the information
across PS interpreter, which executes .runfile with any argument file.

Per Adobe specification, a resource category can define the ResourceFileName procedure,
which generates a resource file name from resource instance name.
Since Ghostscript uses an extended search method for finding resource files,
the strong Adobe's semantics appears inapplicable.
Ghostscript implements an extended semantics.

Finding a resource file while executing findresource or resourcestatus,
Ghostscript does not call ResourceFileName. Instead that, it searches directories
with an extended method explained in How Ghostscript finds files.

ResourceFileName may be called from a Postscript program such as a resource installer.
The default implementation for ResourceFileName first checks whether
GenericResourceDir specifies an absolute path. If so, ResourceFileName uses its value
to generate the result. Otherwise, it tries to find an existing resource file with
the extended method. If it succeeds, ResourceFileName returns the path
to the resource file found. Otherwise it uses GenericResourceDir to combine a default path.

Note that with a single resource directory and an absolute ResourceFileName the behavior
appears equivalent to Adobe's one.

The new search method doesn't distinguish 'lib' and 'Resource' directories.

Minor changes :

The operator .file_name_parent is removed.
The operator .file_name_current is removed.

A consistency check is added to gs_res.ps .

file_name_combine : Adding the 'no_neighbour' argument.

DETAILS:

This patch does not change any behavior with a regular build.
It slightly change behavior when built with NEW_COMBINE_PATH 1.

The 'no_neighbour' is a boolean, which protects steps from
a directory to its neighbor directory in file_name_combine.
With true argument the combination

   (x/y) + (../z/t) fails
but
   (x/y) + (../y/t) succeeds.

With false argument both combinations succeed.

The argument is added to both C function and PS operator.

We apply false argument while executing .libfile
and while generating PermitFileReading.
True argument is used in FAPI support to locate
FAPI-handled font files (which generally are not PS files,
and they are not being read with PS operators).

With NEW_COMBINE_PATH 1, THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

Initial commit for the new SAFER logics.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior unless
NEW_COMBINE_PATH is changed to 1. With 0 a minor meanful
change is the replacing .pathstring_not_bare with .file_name_combine
in gs_fapi.ps (which fixes a bug in FAPI support,
and doesn't affect builds with no FAPI).

The change is compatible unless NEW_COMBINE_PATH is 1.
Incompatibility issues with 1 are explained below.

With NEW_COMBINE_PATH 1 the patch defines a new logic for
.libfile, SAFER, and related things :

1. Default values for GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir
   are platform dependent.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).

2. Default value for GenericResourcePathSep is platform dependent.
   The value is used before non-directory items only.
   (The old code always use Unix notation - a bug).
   (The old code used the value before directory items - a bug on OpenVMS).

3. PLRM specifies GenericResourceDir to be a single absolute path name.
   But Ghostscript's tradition is to load library files
   form a list of directories. Since we want to propagate
   this tradition to resource files, we get a conflict.
   To resolve the conflict, we allow GenericResourceDir
   to be a relative path, which is being concatenated with
   LIBPATH items. Thus we provide an extension of Postscript.

4. When a LIBPATH item is being concatenated with GenericResourceDir,
   an abnormal behavior appears when GenericResourceDir references parent.
   Exactly, concatenating the (.) item of LIBPATH with
   the default GenericResourceDir, which is (../Resource/),
   we get (../Resource/), i.e. it searches in a directory,
   which users don't expect to. We work around the abnormal
   behavior with skipping such paths while executing .libfile .

   More precisely, the .libpath algorithm is :

   For each LIBPATH item :
      - combine it with the argument string;
      - if the (reduced) combination refers the parent, skip it;
      - otherwise try to open the path. If succeeded, exit with it.
   If no success, fail with undefinedfilename or invalidfileaccess.

   Here and below we used Unix notation just for simplifying
   the log message. All statements to be generalized for any platform,
   and they are true for any supported platform.

5. A consequence of our workaround for (4) is a new constraint to .libfile :

   Let x is a cwd.
   Let x/../y exists. Lets mark it as y1.
   Let LIBPATH contains cwd and a directory z, which is not cwd.
   Let z/../y exists. Lets mark it as y2.
   Consequently y1 != y2.
   Executing

      (../y/f) .libpath

   searches y2/f, but does not search y1/f .
   The old code searched both in non-safer mode.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

6. A better workaround for (4) would be an implementation
   of RESPATH, which by default generates from LIBPATH
   with replacing (../Resource/) with (./Resource/).
   This requires to maintain a new directory lists.
   .libfile should get an additional argument,
   which specifies a search list - LIBPATH, RESPATH or FONTPATH.
   We do not make this improvement now,
   but will add it to Issues.htm .

7. If a path starts with a number of parent references,
   a template with same number of parent references
   must be added to permission list to allow the access.
   The template (*) allows access to any file.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, because
   the old code ever rejects parents.

8. GenericResourceDir and FontResourceDir are not being added
   to permission list while .locksafe. Instead that,
   we combine them with all LIBPATH items,
   and add the combinations to the permission list
   unless it references parent.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE, but for non-exotic cases
   (such as "(../Resource/CMap/H) .libfile" in a document)
   it should be equivalent to the old behavior.

9. Scratch files with a non-absolute prefix always open
   in a scratch directory. The old code can open them
   in current and parent directories if an user modified
   a default prefix in C code.
   THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE for users who had modified
   a scratch file prefix in C code.
   Permission for scratch directory is not checked
   as well as in old code.

A. The operator .filenamedirseparator is removed,
   because it cannot work properly on OpenVMS.
   On OpenVMS it needs both prefix and trailer to
   determine a correct separator.
   We removed it because the new logics never needs it.

B. The operator .pathstring_not_bare is removed,
   because .file_name_combine performs it's job better.

C. The functions gp_pathstring_not_bare, gp_file_name_references_parent,
   char *gp_file_name_concat_string are not longer in use.

D. New operators added to maintain the new logics :

   <string> <string> .file_name_combine <string>

      Combine a file name with a prefix.
      The first argument is a prefix, the second is a file name.
      Internal syntax of arguments and result is platform dependent.
      The combination is being reduced to a shortest equivalent,
      but if it starts with cwd reference, the starting
      cwd reference persists.

   - .file_name_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between directory item and file item.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourcePathSep.

   - .file_name_directory_separator <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a separator
      which is used in file names between two directory items.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourceDir.

   - .file_name_parent <string>

      Returns a readonly string, which represents a parent reference.
      Used for making the default value of GenericResourceDir
      and GenericResourceDir.

   <string> .file_name_parents <integer>

      Returns an integer equal to the length of maximal
      anchor substring, which includes parent references and separators only.
      Used in generating the permission list from LIBPATH and
      [GenericResourceDir FontResourceDir] as a workaround
      for (6).

   We believe that all them are necessary, except the last one,
   which is temporary used in (8) as a workaround for (6).

gp_file_name_combine : Implementing some useful functions.

DETAILS:

This patch doesn't change any behavior.
The new functions will be used with NEW_COMBINE_PATH=1.

Probably we don't need gp_file_name_reduce, but it's implementation
is pretty nice and isn't obvious.

gp_file_name_is_absolute will replace gp_pathstring_not_bare.
NEW_COMBINE_PATH=1 wan't need a special check for cwd.

gp_file_name_is_from_parent will replace gp_file_name_references_parent.
The new function only check partent at the beginning of the path,
and should be used with reduced paths only.

We could code an in-place reduction with :

    gp_file_name_combine_result
    gp_file_name_reduce_inplace(char *buffer, uint *blen)
    {
        return gp_file_name_reduce(buffer, *blen, buffer, blen);
    }

but we believe that

1. Aliasing const with non-const isn't a valid C.
   Rather GS contains multiple const hacks, we don't want to add another one.

2. The input buffer must have space for the trailing zero,
   which is not accounted in *blen.

The patch also includes a minor cleanup of comments and gp_file_name_combine_generic.

Implementing gp_file_name_combine.

DETAILS :

This patch introduces a new code, which is currently
disabled with "#define NEW_COMBINE_PATH 0" in gp.h .

The new function gp_file_name_combine concatenates
two paths and then reduce the concatenation with excluding
parent references when possible. It is platform dependent,
but we could factor out a big common part - see gp_file_name_combine_generic.
Platforms define 8 small helpers for it.

The gp_file_name_combine and its helpers were debugged on Windows
with emulating other platforms. A help wanted to
test them on real platforms. For testing them
replace 0 with 1 in the definition of NEW_COMBINE_PATH
in gp.h and rebuild.

We do not protect definitions of new functions with
NEW_COMBINE_PATH switch, because we want them to be syntax-checked.

Some old functions, such as gp_pathstring_not_bare,
gp_file_name_concat_string will be reconsidered later,
because the helpers perform similar work in a generalized way.
Probably some of old ones to be removed. Our strong intention is
to remove gp_pathstring_not_bare, because it's behavior looks
strange from the user's end.

Support for JBIG2 streams with a JBIG2Globals shared data reference.

DETAILS:

The JBIG2Decode filter can take an optional /JBIG2Globals parameter,
always an indirect object reference to another stream. This commit adds
a new .jbig2makeglobalctx operator that takes a bytestring contanting
the global stream data, runs it through the decoder library and wraps
the resulting context pointer in an astruct which is returned as a
special -jbig2globalctx- object on the postscript stack.

A new procedure called from inside applyfilters in the pdf decoder takes
care of spooling the global data into the bytestring and installing the
astruct under the .jbig2globalctx key in the parameter dictionary. The
filter implementation looks for this and passes it to the page decoder
instance if it's available. The original JBIG2Globals key is ignored by
the actual decode filter implementation.

Fixing the device finalization problem.

DETAILS :

pdfwrite (and possibly other devices) perform a huge work within close_device.
Since close_device is called via finalization method from memory
manager, some device structures could be released before calling
device_close, so that the huge work could not safely complete.
Also it could return error codes, which were entirely lost.

This patch calls gs_closedevice implicitly when a device
is about to uninstall. We catch 2 such events : when the interpreter
is about to exit, and when the interpreter executes setdevice.
This should be enough for "external" devices, such as printer drivers.
Internal devices do not receive these calls.

Note that a call to gx_device_fill_in_procs is added after assign_dev_procs
from gx_default_create_buf_device. Not sure why it was not done before.
After assign_dev_procs, ppmraw had ununitialized procs.

Also note that is_open flag is now unconditionally resets in gs_closedevice.
The new code needs to reset it to prevent redundant call to close_device from
device finalization method. The redundant call causes
a crash if pdfwrite has insufficient disk space to store the
output file (debugged with dina3_watermark.pdf) .

This is initial commit for implementing static resources.

DETAILS :

1. Adding a new iodevice %static% with the new file ziodevst.c .
It is used for opening files placed in static data segment.
They need to be accessed as PS files due to multiple reasons,
including the implementation of gs_ciddc.ps and for PS procedure
ResourceFileName defined in PLRM.

2. Implementing a queue for delayed invocation
of initialization functions at end of gs_init.
This feature is necessary due to customized
builds of Ghostscript : some 'dev' depend each
on other and some functions are needed to execute
after all devs are preset. Currently it is only used
for obtaining the Unicode Decoding resource,
but later it will be used for perfectly consistent
processing of font and CID font map files,
both with FAPI and without it.

3. gs_resmp.ps slightly changed for handling
resource maps which are not defined as files.

4. The new file gs_resst.ps implements a procset
for handling static resource files. Both gs_resst.ps and
gs_ciddc.ps use the %static% iodevice.

5. The new file gs_resst.ps creates a map of resource files
placed in static segment. Later it would be nice
to generate it during GS installation. With the defined
resource set gs_init.obj grows up to 1.5Meg,
but both MSVC and gcc/Cygwin could handle it.

Currently all resources in gs_stres.ps are COMMENTED OUT
to prevent problems building Ghostscript with COMILE_INITS=1
on Mac and VMS. To uncomment them, replace '%-' with empty string.

This patch was locally tested with entire comparefiles
with COMPILE_INITS=0. It should not cause regressions.
Also it was slightly tested with COMPILE_INITS=1 :
the static resources work fine.

The patch assumes that during a GS build resource files
are placed in gs/Resource/ . It uses 1 Decoding and
a dozen of CMaps, which are necessary for the CID font emulation
and for FAPI to work. You need to uncomment them
in gs_stres.ps .

When GS is invoked, resources are being loaded from both
the static segment and from the OLD(!!!!!) default path.
In other words, the resource machinery works fine,
but the default resource path is not fixed yet.
I intend to fix it in the next day or two.

The patch depends on
http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-cvs/2003-February/002950.html

The patch does not include CMaps and Decodings resources.
They to be added separately.

Fix : Improving the CIDFontType 2 font copying.

DETAILS :

I believe that the code about copying CIDFontType 2 glyphs
is overcomplicated with mixing CIDs and GIDs, and needs to be
cleaned up. The old code had an obvious inconsistency :
it allocated a smaller array for glyph indices than written,
causing a heap damage. This patch simply makes the code to be
self-consistent. I can't say that I completely
understand whether CIDs/GIDs passed correctly or not.
Now it is working, but the correctness was not proved,
and Acrobat Reader doesn't show the glyph with /CIDTTEMUL
(see below).

The problem was detected with COMPILE_INITS=1 with emulating
a CID wont with mshei.ttf . The following program had crashed
with pdfwrite :

/glyph 2300 def
/ShinGo-Bold /CIDFont findresource
100 scalefont setfont
100 200 moveto glyph glyphshow
/CIDTTEMUL /CIDFont findresource
100 scalefont setfont
100 100 moveto glyph glyphshow
showpage

with the cidfmap file like this :

/ShinGo-Bold << /FileType /TrueType /Path (f:/WIN2000/Fonts/batang.ttf) /SubfontID 0 /CSI [(Japan1) 2] >> ;
/CIDTTEMUL << /FileType /TrueType /Path (f:/WIN2000/Fonts/mshei.ttf) /SubfontID 0 /CSI [(Japan1) 2] >> ;

The effect is indeterministic.
When I build GS with regenerate gs_init.c,
it crashed if run in same session of Developer Studio.
But if I close-open the Developer Studio and run GS,
it doesn't crash.

The patch should enlarge the array, which was written outside
the index range. The problem looks gone.
Meanwhile the CID/GID logics in gxcopy.c to be revised someday.

pdfwrite : Account GlyphNames2Unicode while creating ToUnicode CMaps for simple fonts.

DETAILS:

This patch improves the previous one.
It generalizes the GlyphNames2Unicode processing for any simple font.

GlyphNames2Unicode is an undocumented facility, which Adobe Postscript
printer driver PScript5.dll Version 5.2 uses to communicate with
Adobe Distiller. Adobe applies it to Type 3 and Type 42 fonts.

Adobe uses Type 3 with GlyphNames2Unicode only for compatibility
with interpreters, which cannot handle Type 32. With other
interpreters (including Ghostscript) the generated PS program
skips GlyphNames2Unicode data. Therefore the feature
is now implemented for Type 3 but it is not involved while
processing such documents. Need to patch "32 /FontType findresource"
to involve it. Probably with pdfwrite the DSC parser should recognize
the creator and exclude 32 from /FontType resource category.

This patch unwinds the enhanced functionality of gs_font_procs::glyph_info
with GLYPH_INFO_UTC16, which was done with the previous patch,
and introduces a new virtual function gs_font_procs::decode_glyph.
Doing so because GLYPH_INFO_UTC16 causes multiple redundant code
for various font types due to dependence on interpreter structures.

SF bug #684120 tracks additional issues.

pdfwrite : Account GlyphNames2Unicode while creating ToUnicode CMaps

DETAILS:

GlyphNames2Unicode is an undocumented facility, which Adobe Postscript
printer driver PScript5.dll Version 5.2 uses to communicate with
Adobe Distiller. Adobe applies it to Type 3 and Type 42 fonts.

Type 3 with GlyphNames2Unicode is used only for compatibility
with interpreters, which cannot handle Type 32.
Since Ghostscript is not such, there is no need to implement
Type 3 with GlyphNames2Unicode. We don't do that.

This patch enhances the functionality of gs_font_procs::glyph_info
with retrieving Unicode UTC-16 code for a glyph. This enhancement
is implemented for practically useful cases only, which are
restricted with Type 42.

The gs_font_dir::glyph_to_unicode
callback is now removed because it is not longer useful.

SF bug #684120 tracks additional issues.

Working on this patch, I tried put the Unicode Decoding table
as a default value to FontInfo.GlyphNames2Unicode and remove the unicode_decoder.
But it appears not working, because test.ps for SF bug #529103 needs to
collect substitutions from both FontInfo.GlyphNames2Unicode and Unicode Decoding.

I removed the "WARNING: /Unicode /Decoding resource in not accessible",
because the flag for preventing its repetitions is not accessible from
gs_font_procs::glyph_info. A similar warning in lib/gs_pdfwr.ps still works.

pdfwrite : Generating ToUnicode CMaps for simple fonts.
For fonts with random encoding it allows to Copy-Paste text
from viewers and to search a text.

DETAILS:

This code requires /Unicode /Decoding resource.
If the resource is absent, PDF will be written without ToUnicode CMap,
a warning is written to stdout explaining that the resource may be useful,
and another warning may be written to stderr if the resource is actually
useful for the document.

To access the resource I introduced a special operator .setupUnicodeDecoder .
It is called from gs_pdfwr.ps and stores the resource to gs_font_dir,
together with a callback which performs the decoding.
This is only a way to pass the resource through the graphics library.
It is definitely not a device parameter, and converting it to
C structures would be hard.

I don't like the big stuff added into zfont.c, but I haven't got
a better idea where to put it.

The CID to TT mapping : Building CIDMap with SubstNWP.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior if a new file
gs/lib/cidttmap is not added. Normally it is not.

With this patch narrow, wide and proportional Romans
may substitute each another while emulating a CJK CID font
with True Type font. Usually True Types contain insufficient
glyph to render all them. The substitution prevents missed glyphs.

This patch introduces a new special operator .fillCIDMap .
It composes a CID map from a Decoding, a True Type cmap,
and SubstNWP. PS code would be too big and slow for this purpose.

The implementation of the CID font emulator is almost complete except 2 features :

1. The CID font to CID font mapper and
   the True Type to CID font mapper use different map files -
   cidfmap and cidttmap.

2. An optimization is wanted for gs_type42_get_outline_from_TT_file.
   See comment in there.

Minor changes :

- Fixed a bug in gs_cidfn.ps which tried to store a local
  FontMatrix to a global font dictionary.

- A portion of code is factored out from zfapi.c to share with  .fillCIDMap

CID font emulation : Choosing a cmap with gs/lib/xlatmap.

DETAILS:

This patch only changes a code which work for

This is a next step of the CID font emulation.
Now it can handle all Windows JCK charsets, including Unicode-16.
In other words, a CJK font with any Windows charset can be used for emulation.
To handle other CJK charsets one should create an appropriate
CIDDecoding resource and add it into gs/lib/xlatmap.

Minor changes :

- Speeded up the TT file parser using the 'setfileposition'.

- Improved some diagnostic messages.

1. Providing an access to glyphs on demand.
2. Handle TTC font format.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior if a new file
gs/lib/cidttmap is not added. Normally it is not.

With this patch glyf and loca tables are being skipped while loading
a True Type into RAM. An access by demand is provided instead
(This works for CIDFontType 2; it is not used for Type 42).

Map file may contain records with SubfontID, which
specifies a font number in a TTC collection.
TTC format is implemented for disk files only,
because embedded fonts never use it.

To provide the on-demand access, the patch introduces a special
extension of the Postscript language.
A CIDFontType 2 dictionary may contain /File with a file value.
It should be a positionable file of the TTF or TTC format.
When it presents, the dictionary must contain /file_table_pos,
which's value is a dictionary of 2-element arrays, which specify
position and length of a TT table in the file. 2 arrays
must present with keys /loca and /glyph.

We would like to optimize this implementation.

DETAILS:

This patch only changes a code which work for

Secondary changes :

- improving some comments and function names.

Enhancing the resource machinery with mapping CID fonts to True Types.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior if a new file
gs/lib/cidttmap is not added. Normally it is not.

Adding 2 new files gs_fntem.ps and gs_cidtt.ps and reorganizing
old files gs_cidfn.ps, gs_fapi.ps, gs_resmp.ps with them.
This moves a part of FAPI support to a more general level.
The moved stuff is shared with the FAPI and the new CID font mapper.

After this change Ghostscript can load Unicode True Type fonts
as a substitution to a CIDFontType 2 and render it.
At least the Windows font PMINGLIU.TTF succeeds.
But the implementation is very incomplete :

1. The CID to GID mapping is fully wrong.

2. Entire True Type fonts are loaded into VM.

3. The CID font to CID font mapper and
   the True Type to CID font mapper use different map files -
   cidfmap and cidttmap.

All these 3 solutions are temporary and to be improved later.

To involve the new feature, create a new file gs/lib/cidttmap,
and put records to there of the following format :

/ShinGo-Bold  << /FileType /TrueType /Path (F:/WIN2000/Fonts/PMINGLIU.TTF) /CSI [(Japan1) 2] /SubstNWP /Japan1 >> ;

It is similar to gs/lib/FAPIcidfmap, see Use.htm about the latter.

Implementing a new user parameter AlignToPixels and
a new command line argument AlignToPixels.
They allow to choose the alignment of glyphs to
integral pixels or to subpixels while a text rendering.

DETAILS:

This patch should not change any behavior except
-dAlignToPixels=0 is specified.

A change to documentation about the new parameter is included.

With NEW_TYPE1_HINTER = 1 the value 0 of AlignToPixels implies :

1. Caching a glyph raster, fractional glyph origins
give different images, which are stored
in individual slots. The space consumption in the
character cache increases. This happens for all font types.

2. While hinting a Type 1 or 2 font, glyph origins and widths
are rounded to subpixels rather than to pixels, and the grid fitting
is done to the subpixel grid.

CIDFontType 0 descendents had NULL pointer to gs_font_dir.
The new code needs to access the font directory,
so the pointer is now set.

The new code needs glyph origin and log2_scale to lookup
a glyph in cache. Therefore show_proceed and
set_cache_device were reorganized with a new function
compute_glyph_raster_params. The new algorithm uses a
slightly different (and more complicated) logics
for computation and initialization of penum->origin.
It was well tested, but in case of problems please
consider it as a weak point.

(2) Coded an alignment to subpixels.
(3) Removed a hack about suppressing a microscopic segment.

DETAILS:

This patch changes a disabled code only.

It codes an alignment to subpixels, but for a while
it is permanently turned off.

gx_path_init_bbox_accumulator is used by gs_default_glyph_info for
computing a bounding box for a glyph. It does not
store segments to memory, therefore a reference to memory manager
is not provided. But the new hinter accesses it
if a stack-allocated array overflows.

Implementing an immediate transfer of outline poles to
the output path without storing them intermediately in arrays.
This mode works when a grid fitting is not required.
Only exception is flex poles : up to 9 of them
are stored in arrays while flex accumulates.
It must not overflow arrays.

The hack about microscopic segment was a rudiment of old code.
gs_op1_closepath was unintentionally called while
exporting an outline from the hinter. I believe that
the hack is incorrect and should not be applied.
Some outlines render differently.

I'm sorry for mixing 3 things in a single patch.
I've started the subpixel alignment, and
then occasionally discovered other problems.
It's hard to separate changes after they are done,
and I don't think that the separation is so important.

This also closes the Source Forge bug
"[ 663635 ] ps2pdf cannot tune spacing by xshow for CJK text".
and provides better glyph positions with ashow for WMode 1.

There are small changes to graphics library :

   The function was factored out from an old code.

2. Provided a default metrics for CID fonts for WMode 1.

   function glyph_info cannot pass some necessary information (WMode).

Minor changes :

1. Removed the comment "We know that the Tw and Tc values are zero",
   It was wrong a long time ago.

2. Inserted a comment about unimplemented DW2. An old code near the

Within the display device, correctly allocate the memory device
with the correct structure descriptor.

DETAILS:
The display device was allocating a memory device by taking a
memory device prototype from gdev_mem_device_for_bits and then
using gs_copydevice on it.  This allocates the wrong size
because the prototype does not have a structure descriptor.  The
correct way is to allocate it with gs_alloc_struct with
st_device_memory as an argument.  This bug was found when using
the display device in GhostPCL, which was complaining on
shutdown about the unfreed structure descriptors left behind by
gs_copydevice.

The prior code in pick_cell_size used an unusual metric for
measuring the "closeness of fit" of an actual screen cell to the
requested frequency and angle. If the angle variation was 0 (quite
likely for the common 0/45/90 degree angles), the frequency
variation was ignored. In addition, this metric was very sensitive

Reducing the C stack consumption in ztype1execchar.
The new code must be equivalent to the old one.

DETAILS:

The new type 1 hinter (with NEW_TYPE1_HINTER = 1 in gx.h)
puts more 11K of data to C stack. Perhaps due to a recursion
in bbox_draw 2 instances of the hinter were placed in C stack
simultaneously, causing C stack overflow with gswin32c.exe on
Windows NT 4.0 (but not on Windows 2000).

Perhaps the recursion is not necessary.
Reorganizing the sequence of calls to avoid the recursion.
New argument 'exec_cont' was added to several
functions for transferring the call request to clients.
Corresponding comments are added in code.

Also z1_glyph_info prototype was added in ichar1.h .
It was missed a long time ago, Cygwin/gcc warned.

A further improvement may be done with factoring out
a common code from bbox_finish_fill, bbox_finish_stroke,
bbox_fill, bbox_stroke. Delaying it until a regression testing.

DETAILS:

This is a fix for systems without interlibrary dependencies. We don't use
the LIBS variable constructed by default by the AC_CHECK_LIB macro and
did not maintain it in our previous zlib test, thus -lz was not included
on the link line in the libpng test.

Our primary test systems for the autoconf build (Debian GNU/Linux and MacOS X + fink)
include an interlibrary dependency, so this did not cause a problem. On
systems where this is not the case, it results in a confusing error.

Dropout prevention : (1) Replace the horizontal line processing.

in horizontal line handling.

With self-intersections, the side of spot interior
may be different for different parts of same line.

Initial commit for a new type 1 hinter.
This patch must not change any behavior.

DETAILS:

This is a porting from HINTER branch.

The old hinter cannot handle overlapping hints,
but real fonts do use them.

The handling of overlapped hints cannot be done within
a single-pass algorithm. Therefore we intend to replace entire thing.
Besides, it should fix a set of known problems :

- stem degradation at small resolutions;
- stem missing or misrecognition;
- proper adjustment of dependent stems;
- suppress overshoots closer to Adobe;

This patch introduces a couple of new macros,
which will be removed later.

Previous commit mistakenly included the state.dr value as both the X and

The hypot is actually all that is required to handle getting the correct

The use of state.dr for both X and Y preceded the use of hypot on dev_dr

It is the correct value with dropout prevention.

The last revision of dropout prevention algorithm
appears buggy : the order of margins in margin_list
can be wrong and causes dropouts. This is essentially
important with CJK True Types, which have thing horizontal
stems and no hinting with GS.

This revision replaces the representation of margins
with a simpler one. It is not optimized for bold
characters, perhaps the optimization is not hard.
See comment in code about "bold".

A good advantage is the removal of insert_pseudo_margin.

Improving and optimizing the dropout prevention algorithm
with splitting gx_default_fill_parallelogram into 2 variants.

DETAILS:

This patch almost changes a disabled code.
A simple reorganization of some enabled code should not
cause a behavior difference.

Filling a "small" character, we always subdivide trapezoids into
rectangles instead passing them to device virtual function.
It allows :

1. Not passing narrow trapezoids to applications
which implement fill_trapezoid with own means;
Narrow trapezoids could cause dropouts in there.

2. Optimize variants of fill_trapezoid algorithm which
are used for different purposes (preventing about 10% slowdown
with shadings).

We believe this change isn't harmful because
regularly we render small characters to cache device,
which simply forwards trapezoids to default implementation.
Alternatively we could insert a check for narrow trapezoids
into loop_fill_trap, but such check appears complex and
it would sensibly reduce performance.

New files added : gdevddrw.h, gxdtfill.h .
Change to lib.mak accounts them.

Besides that, with dropout prevention we now skip empty paths
in characters, because Adobe doesn't paint them.

Initial commit for the dropout prevention code in rasterizer.
It doesn't not change any behavior.

DETAILS:

Switching to new code is being controlled with DROPOUT_PREVENTION
macro defined in gx.h . Now it is set to "use old code".

This patch :
1. Ports the "margin" algorithm from HINTER branch.
   Now the algorithm renamed to "pseudo-rasterization".

2. Ports the dropout prevention to gx_default_fill_trapezoid from HINTER branch,
   providing a contiguous fill for slightly slanted trapezoids.

3. Adds CONNECT_RECTANGLES into gx_default_fill_trapezoid
   providing a contiguous fill for highly slanted trapezoids.

4. Fixes some problems in the "pseudo-rasterization".

5. Disables all hacks about path adjustment and oversampling
   when DROPOUT_PREVENTION is on. Those hacks were attempts
   to fix dropouts for small characters, but they do not solve
   the problem completely.

6. Provide visual trace instructions for debugging purpose.

Changes to gxpcopy.c and gxpflat.c only insert visual trace instructions for
debugging purpose. Currently all them compile to empty code.

Changes to gdevddrw.c, gxchar.c, gxtype1.c, gx.h
are protected with DROPOUT_PREVENTION. With current settings they
compile to old code.

Changes to gxfill.c are not so obvious. I was unhappy with duplicating
a thousand of lines in #if...#else...#endif. Therefore
I've inserted some dynamic checks. They are controlled with
'pseudo_rasterization' flag. Currently it always false,
so that inserted sections are either bypassed or immediately
return from subroutines.

Changes to lib.mak only add some dependences on vdtrace.h .

In local testing the patch caused no difference with
Comparefiles (if DROPOUT_PREVENTION is 0).

If someone wants to try new code, DROPOUT_PREVENTION to be modified in gx.h .
In this case all old hacks about path adjustment are disabled,
and therefore characters render some lighter.
Visual trace may be activated with -Tf option in gs command line.
Note that it paints a big draft for any character rendered,
so you should run only simple PS files with a single character.
Also the draft scale is hardcoded in VD_SCALE constants,
so it may give an unuseful result with big character rasters.
At last please remember that visual trace window is implemented
only for Windows - other platforms will not paint anything.
The visual trace window does not implement a regeneration of painting,
therefore windows must not overlap. Run gswin32.exe with no file,
move windows and then perform 'quit' to store window layout to system Registry.

here is a simple test, which visualize improvements when
DROPOUT_PREVENTION is on :

	%!
	100 350 moveto
	/Courier findfont 2 scalefont [5 0 0 1 0 0] makefont setfont
	(/) show
	showpage

With 72dpi the old code paints nothing.
The (DROPOUT_PREVENTION=1) paints a spot.

Testing the new code with -r300 001.01.ps, the box 001-12 renders better :
no dropouts in "4", characters look better.

In gx.h I've added FILL_TRAP_WITH_SWAPPED_AXES flag. The goal is to archive
and document a dead branch of the development. I'd like to store it into
archive and then remove it in the next revision.

Two temporary configuration switches added for benchmarking purpose :

- PSEUDO_RASTERIZATION in gxfill.c disables the pseudo-rasterization
  separately from other changes.

- CONTIGUOUS_FILL disables additional checks in gdevddrw.c
  separately from other changes.

With text documents performance change is almost invisible.
With Coons01.ps each of these flags give a 10% slowdown.
I guess the reason is that the code becomes too complex for
global optimization with MSVC 6.0 for Intel Pentium 3.
Other compilers/processors may give different results.

Prevent the bbox put_params from using the color mapping

Fixes Sourceforge bug #645531 "seg fault: bbox device + PAPERSIZE".

DETAILS:
Using "-sPAPERSIZE=a4 -sDEVICE=bbox" crashes in GS 8 when the
device parameters are being set prior to opening the bbox device.
bbox_put_params calls bbox_copy_params, gx_device_black
then the bbox encode_color which is NULL.
This is wrong because encode_color must not be called before
the device is open.  See doc/Drivers.htm#Life_cycle for details.
Prior to the DeviceN changes this did not matter because
the map_rgb_color function was valid.  Post DeviceN the
encode_color procedure is called and this is NULL until
just before the bbox device is opened.

The fix prevents bbox_copy_params from calling the
encode_color procedure while the device is closed.

The file contains an embedded TT font subset that has a badly formatted

for specific glyphs. The 'post' table in question maps a bunch of glyphs
that are not part of the subset to the first name in glyphnames section,
but the glyphnames section is empty. It should have at least a single byte
of 0x00 to form a zero length Pascal string.

I also added a warning that prints if the DEBUG is enabled. Since the
'postglyphs' string is automatically extended with a 0x00 byte when the
problem is detected, the warning only prints once for the font.

Fix (FAPI) : Passing the replaced metrics to renderer.

DETAILS

FAPI client provides replaced metrics data in all cases.

UFST bridge now provides a minimal handling for replaced metrics -
for fonts with MetricsCount only. Other cases require
to implement a new feature to UFST.

Free Type is not fixed with this patch.
Need to implement a new feature in Free Type.

<blockquote><pre>
Handling of OpenType (OTTO) fonts with CFF fonts inside would fail if the
CFF table was not the first table in the table directory. Also stack
overflow could occur when building the FDSelect array. Now Asian fonts
sold by Adobe (as OpenType .otf fonts) can be used with Ghostscript.

DETAILS:

The initial table scanning checked the 32-bit table type against the
(CFF ) string, but then failed to skip the following 12 bytes if the table
was not CFF. Since the initial table is usually BASE, most OTTO fonts were
not usable.

Also the FDSelect array construction used the stack, so could easily
overflow if there was a largest glyph index in the font was too large. The
method used creates a 65535 element array, then fills it using the info
from the font's FDSelect info. The extra elements of the array are 'trimmed'
using getinterval.

When adding a missing showpage to an EPS file,
don't bind showpage to allow user to override it.

DETAILS:
The EPS encapsulation code in ghostscript adds a showpage
if one is not present, so that displaying, printing and
converting all behave the same.  Some users are feeding
multiple EPS files to ghostscript, intending to print them
on a single page.  The current code will print each EPS file
on a single page.  For example following code would print
three pages:
  save
   /showpage {} def
   save (file1.eps) run restore
   save (file2.eps) run restore
  restore
  showpage
With this fix, it will print a single page.

Other ways to avoid this problem are to use -dNOEPS,
or (file.eps) (r) file cvx exec
