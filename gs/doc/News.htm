<h3><a name="Version7.20"></a>Version 7.20 (2002-03-29)</h3>

<p>
This is the first development release after the 7.0x series. While
it is a development release, it is likely to be quite stable and
robust, largely thanks to automated regression testing.

<p> Major changes include:

<ul>
<li>Support for external font renderers such as Agfa UFST.

<li>An optional "diskn" feature that emulates the "%disk" devices
found on some Adobe printers.

<li>The <tt><b>-dSAFER</b></tt> flag now tightens read access to
arbitrary files, as well as write access. Thus,
<tt><b>-dSAFER</b></tt> in this release is equivalent to
<tt><b>-dSAFER -dPARANOIDSAFER</b></tt> in 7.04. This will break some
viewers, notably gv.

</ul>

<p> In addition, the following improvements have been merged from
the 7.04 release:

<ul>

<li>A rather serious security hole, where PostScript code could cause
arbitrary commands to be executed, has been patched.

<li>This release integrates the IJS driver, which makes it much easier
to add and upgrade printer drivers without needing to recompile
Ghostscript.

<li>There is a configure script for automatically configuring the
build system on Unix platforms. Those who enjoy the fun of hand-editing
the makefile are still welcome to do so.

</ul>

<p>
And, of course, the usual bug fixing and performance enhancement.

<p>
There has also been considerable development of our DeviceN
implementation and related color work on a private branch. These new
features are <em>not</em> included in this release. We expect to merge
them into the main branch soon.

<p>
There exists another private branch which integrates PCL and PostScript/PDF
in the same executable. Again, that work is not reflected in this
release.

<h3><a name="7.20_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>

<pre>
(Interpreter)
	- Updates clients and implementors for the new glyph outline data
structure.
	- -dSAFER flag now restricts read access to arbitrary files in
addition to restricting write access.
	- While not strictly an incompatible change, authors of drivers
with potential security implications are encouraged to review the
security changes, including the LockSafetyParams mechanism.

(Library)
	- Changes all procedures for getting glyph outline data to return
the data by storing it into a gs_glyph_data_t structure that includes memory
management information.  This is a NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change to both
implementors and clients.  It corrects a significant design error: formerly
these procedures encoded memory management information in their return code,
which was obscure and error-prone.  See src/gsgdata.[hc].
