<h3><a name="Version8.62"></a>Version 8.62 (2008-02-29)</h3>

<p>
This version is the next in our line of scheduled semi-annual releases.
<p>
There were approximately 55 bugs fixed since version 8.61. Some fixes
and improvements of note were:
<p>
COMPILE_INITS=1 was broken in 8.61 and now works as expected.
<p>
Fonts are now distributed in the Resource/Font directory and will be
included in the executable if COMPILE_INITS=1
<p>
The tiffsep device was fixed for using more than 8 colorants.
<p>
Shadings, overprinting and transparency were optimized and are substantially
faster than in 8.61, particularly for large format or high resolution
rendering when using the 'clist' banding mode.
<p>
Changes were made to prevent near unbounded growth in memory usage and
corresponding performance problems on a few test cases.
<p>
The 'pdfwrite' device was improved to fix some compatibility issues with
PDF/A and to improve some font embedding and other issues.
<p>
The 'ht_ccsto.ps' Stochastic Threshold array was completely changed to
be more useful. The values in the threshold array were inverted, so
the number of 'light' colors was limited and using it generally caused
prints that were too dark.
<p>
The 'runpdfbegin', 'dopdfpages' and 'runpdfend' PostScript pseudo-operators
that were inadvertently removed in 8.61 were restored. This also restored
the functionality of toolbin/pdf_info.ps to display PDF creator stats,
fonts used and page sizes.
<p>
The halftone tile cache sizes and cache effectiveness were improved to
help the performance when tiling with large cells or threshold arrays.
<p>

<h3><a name="8.62_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>

<p>
Not strictly a compatibility issue, but the default URW (GPL) fonts are now
distributed in the Resource/Font/ path which can increase the number of
file handles open for PostScript that opens all of the resources. Also
the size of the %rom% rom file system within the executable when using
COMPILE_INITS=1 is larger by the amount needed for the fonts.
<p>
Also not strictly incompatible, but some alternate fixed-point code 
was stripped out, so FPU_TYPE and other FPU related makefile macros
are gone or don't cause any difference in the code generated. Also the 
'USE_ASM' macro was removed, since we expect modern compilers to do 
sufficient optimization.
<p>
Some old (deprecated) "helper" scripts were removed: gsindent, gssubst,
many2pdf.tcl, and pre.
<p>
The unused 'cmap' (special color mapping) and 'ropc' devices were 
removed from the distribution.
<p>
The 'ht_ccsto.ps' Stochastic Threshold array was completely changed to
be more useful. The values in the threshold array were inverted, so
the number of 'light' colors was limited and using it generally caused
prints that were too dark. This is an improvement, but incompatible
in that anyone using it previously would see much different grays/
colors.
<p>
The SYSTEM_CONSTANTS_ARE_WRITABLE compile time define was removed
as was the "EXTEND_NAMES" makefile macro (still accessible using
a compiler flag define).
