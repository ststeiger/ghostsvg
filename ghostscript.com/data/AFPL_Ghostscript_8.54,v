@Artifex Software, Inc. and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the release of AFPL Ghostscript 8.54. This is a maintenance release in the stable 8.5x series.

Major new features include:

* The COMPILE_INITS build define now generates a compressed read-only filesystem which is linked into the executable and accessible from the interpreter as a new %rom% iodevice. This both improves installed footprint and allows using the same mechanism for embedding Resource files and fonts as well as postscript library and configuration files.
* This release also supports the proprietary Luratech JBIG2 and JPEG 2000 libraries. Commercial customers with an appropriate license can use these both for image decode and to create PDF files using these compression formats with the pdfwrite device.
* All source releases now include all the 3rd part library dependencies. It it no longer necessary to download libpng, libjpeg or zlib separately if they are not installed on your system.
* In addition there are a large number of bug fixes and rendering improvements.

Source is available for download from the usual locations:

ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs854/

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/

MS Windows binaries and other packages will appear as they become available.

The basic font set is distributed separately. We recommend [ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs854/ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11.tar.gz ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11.tar.gz] for this release.
