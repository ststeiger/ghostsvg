= Latest release

Ghostpcl 1.50 is the current stable release.

* [http://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/GPL/ghostpdl/ghostpdl-1.50.tar.bz2 ghostpcl_1.50.tar.bz2]

This is the current release of Ghostpcl. To be useful, the release also requires a font set. An archive of the standard 80 TrueType fonts from URW is available below, distributed under the [Aladdin Free Public License].

Only source code is provided. We do not provide executable binaries. See the included documentation for build instructions. This is currently supported only on Windows and Unix-like systems.

= URW fonts

These are the set of 80 standard TrueType fonts from URW in a separate archive. Since the fonts are included in the release these archives are merely for the convenience of other users.

* [ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/GhostPCL/urwfonts-1.41.tar.bz2 urwfonts-1.41.tar.bz2]

The 1.41 font set is the same as the 1.40 except for the ArtLinePrinter font.

The same set of 80 standard fonts from URW are also available in Type 1 versions for users who prefer that format. These are also licensed the AFPL unless you have a commercial OEM license agreement with Artifex covering them. Note that Artifex has not extensively tested the Type 1 versions, and so cannot yet warrant perfect accuracy. You may want to take this into account in your own quality assurance tests.

* [ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/GhostPCL/urwfonts_t1-1.40.tar.bz2 urwfonts_t1-1.40.tar.bz2]
