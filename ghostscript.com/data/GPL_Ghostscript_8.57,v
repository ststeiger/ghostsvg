@Artifex Software, Inc. and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the 
release of GPL Ghostscript 8.57. This is a stable release in the 8.5x 
series.

In addition to the usual bug fixes, there are specific performance and quality improvements in the areas of patterns, shading and image filtering. Also new in this release is an implementation of the Well Tempered Screening algorithm in an output device, using Graeme Gill's IMDI library for efficient color mapping.

See the file doc/Changes.htm in the distribution for a complete list of 
changes.

The release is available from the usual locations:
