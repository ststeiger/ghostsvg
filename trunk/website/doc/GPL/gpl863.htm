<p>
Approximately 238 bugs have been fixed since version 8.62. Of particular 
note are robustness and performance improvements with large files, 
invalid PDF, and font handling.

The major new feature of this release is multithreaded rendering. This 
can be requested by passing -dNumRenderingThreads=n on the command line. 
The input document is first parsed, and then each page is split into n 
bands which are rendered concurrently. This can provide a significant 
reduction in processing time on multi-core systems.

Images are now always interpolated in their source colorspace. This 
improves correctness for XPS documents and avoids bypassing the custom 
color management callbacks for interpolated images. Interpolation and 
color management are both expensive operations, so this affects 
performance with large images. The effect can be positive or negative 
depending on the file and the target resolution. If performance is a 
problem, we suggest running with -dNOINTERPOLATION.

Support for OpenPrinting Vector devices has been upgraded to version 
1.0.

There are two new devices in this release, both experimental. Behdad 
Esfahbod has contributed a cairo output device which uses the cairo 
graphics library to generate PDF, SVG, EPS, or PNG files, based on the 
requested filename extension. The svgwrite device directly outputs 
Scalable Vector Graphics, the W3C XML vector graphics format. Both 
support only vector art at this point; text and images will not be 
represented efficiently. 

<p>
Thanks to everyone whose hard work made this release possible! 

<h2>Post-release news</h2>
<p>
After you get this version of Ghostscript, we suggest that you track news, 
updates, and fixes here or at the Ghostscript website,
<a href="http://ghostscript.com/">ghostscript.com</a>.

<h2>Incompatible changes</h2>

<p>
The maximum number of color components has been reduced to 8 (from 252) 
as a performance improvement. Eight is the largest number commonly used 
and the largest number for which we support continuous tone images. 
Users with special needs can restore the previous behavior by setting 
the GS_CLIENT_COLOR_MAX_COMPONENTS preprocessor symbol to the required 
number of components at compile time.

<p>
The -Z: debugging option now uses 'realtime' instead of 'usertime' when 
reporting timing information on unix-like systems. This has always been 
the case on windows-like systems.

<p>
Obsolete makefiles for the DesqView environment have been removed. 

<h2>Mirror sites</h2>
<p>
The primary site for the Ghostscript source code is 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ghostscript/">
