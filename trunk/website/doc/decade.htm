<H1>Ghostscript: The First Decade</H1>
<HR>
This month (August 1998) marks the 10th anniversary of the first public
release of Ghostscript on August 11, 1988, so we (Aladdin Enterprises, the
principal authors and the copyright holders of Ghostscript) would like to take
the opportunity to share some reflections with the Ghostscript user
community.
<P>
From its beginnings as a PostScript Level 1 interpreter, developed on a 10
MHz 8088 IBM PC/XT under MS-DOS and designed only for previewing and
printing on a few black-and-white printers, Ghostscript has grown to
encompass:
<UL>
<LI>A PostScript Level 2 interpreter
(with many PostScript LanguageLevel 3 features such as CID fonts);
<LI>A PDF 1.2 interpreter, and a PostScript to PDF "distiller";
<LI>Previewing, printing on a wide range of
printers, and rasterizing into a variety of file formats;
<LI>Implementations on every desktop operating system;
<LI>Commercially competitive quality both in function (as tested by
<A HREF="http://www.gentech.com">Genoa's</A>
industry-standard suites) and in performance (as evidenced by its adoption
in a number of commercial printer and plotter products); and
<LI>An
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/doc/PUBLIC">
innovative licensing model</A>
that provides the benefits of
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">open source (TM)</A> licenses to
end users and to other public-good developers while ensuring that commercial
OEMs pay appropriately to help support further development.
</UL>
We are very
proud that of the many sources of PostScript technology that have
come and gone in the past decade, Aladdin (with its commercial licensing
partner, Artifex Software Inc.) is now recognized in the industry as a
stable, credible supplier that deserves as serious consideration as its much
larger competitors.
<P>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank some of the many people in
what is now called the open source world for their help along the way:
<UL>
<LI>Russell Lang, for most of the work on the MS Windows and
OS/2 platform code;
<LI>Tim Theisen, for much of the work on the X Windows code;
<LI>Martin Fong and Mark Lentczner, for the first Macintosh code;
<LI>URW++ Design and Development of Hamburg, Germany, for
contributing a commercial-quality set of fonts;
<LI>Pete Kaiser, for converting all the Ghostscript documentation to HTML;
<LI>The authors of libpng, zlib, and libjpeg, which contribute
valuable parts of Ghostscript's functionality.
</UL>
Dozens of other people have also contributed to Ghostscript in various ways:
they are acknowledged in the Ghostscript documentation.  And of course we
owe special thanks to Richard Stallman for creating the GNU License and
pioneering the concept of open source software, and to the authors of Linux
and the GNU tools that we use for development.
<P>
We would also like to thank two very special commercial licensees:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.innosoft.com">Innosoft International Incorporated</A>,
our very first licensee (1991)
and one of our best customers for many years after that.
Innosoft ported Ghostscript to VMS (now OpenVMS) for use in
their fax system products;
code based in part on their work is now included in
the standard Ghostscript release.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.calcomp.com">CalComp</A>,
our first licensee
to ship a product with Ghostscript embedded in it.
CalComp uses Ghostscript as the rasterization engine in
their Windows driver, and has embedded Ghostscript in five families of large
format inkjet printers, and one small format direct film imaging printer.
They also pioneered the use of a compressed display list in RAM,
a key technology for embedded products that is now included in
the standard Ghostscript release.
</UL>
These companies' willingness to
make a commitment to a small and then-unknown technology supplier
strictly on the basis
of technical evaluation and benchmarking was a great validation of our
commitment to competing on the basis of quality rather than marketing.
<P>
The software industry is an arena of rapid and dramatic change; we cannot
predict whether PostScript and PDF will even be relevant technologies a
decade from now.  In the hope that they will be, we look forward to many
years of providing useful software to the industry and the world.
