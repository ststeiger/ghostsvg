Subject: pstotext - extracting plain text from PostScript<BR>

<P>
We've released a freeware utility "pstotext", that works with GhostScript 
to extract plain-text from PostScript files.  We're releasing it 
publicly because it seems to do a good job on a much wider range 
of PostScript files than previous such programs.
<P>
We've tested pstotext on millions of lines of PostScript, including 
files generated by several versions of drivers from each of Windows, 
Macintosh, and dvips (TeX).  It deals successfully with a wide variety 
of encoding vectors, and it re-assembles words that have been broken 
up for pair-kerning (it doesn't re-assemble words that have been 
hyphenated, though).  It also works (though a little less reliably) 
on Acrobat PDF files. 
<P>
We're distributing pstotext free, in source form.  You'll need a 
copy of a recent version of GhostScript too (at least 3.33 for PostScript, 
at least 3.51 for PDF).  Pstotext should work straightforwardly on 
any Unix system; we haven't done Windows or Macintosh ports.

We created pstotext as spin-off from our Virtual Paper project, where 
we attempted to make on-line reading of lengthy material (like research 
reports, manuals, or entire books) comfortable.  You can read about
