<HR>
<a href="http://www.artofcode.com">artofcode LLC</a>
and <a href="http://www.artifex.com">Artifex Software Inc.</a>
are pleased to announce the
release of AFPL Ghostscript version 7.00. Notable new features include
embedded ICC color profiles, support for the PDF 1.4 transparency and
blending imaging model, and a new API for invoking Ghostscript from other
applications.
<p>
Traditionally, at the time of each major AFPL release, there is a
corresponding GPL release of the previous major release. This time, we
plan to release 6.51 under the GPL, even though it contains significant
features (particularly in PDF generation) over 6.01. The 6.51 release is
scheduled for later this month so we have time to make sure the release
will be fully polished.
<p>
This is the first major release since artofcode LLC has taken over
maintenance of Ghostscript development. I look forward to continuing
to work with the entire Ghostscript community to make Ghostscript even
better.
