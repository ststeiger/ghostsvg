<a href="http://www.artofcode.com">artofcode</a> LLC, <a
href="http://www.aladdin.com">Aladdin</a> Enterprises, and <a
href="http://www.artifex.com">Artifex</a> Software Inc. are
pleased to announce the release of AFPL Ghostscript version 6.50. This
is primarily a maintenance release from the 6.01 public release from
the beginning of this year. It supersedes both AFPL Ghostscript 6.01
and the Artifex supported OEM version 6.12. In addition to a number of
bug fixes, there have been major improvements to PDFwrite output
driver and its underlying high level output API.

<p>
This is the first release since artofcode LLC has taken over
leadership of the future development and enhancement of Ghostscript.
Ghostscript 6.50 has undergone rigorous testing and we are confident
that 6.50 will provide a reliable contribution to the PDF and
PostScript communities.
