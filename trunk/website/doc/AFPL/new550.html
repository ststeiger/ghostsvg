Aladdin Ghostscript 5.50 is now available from

<PRE>
	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs550/">ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs550/</A>
		ghostscript-5.50.tar.gz (source code)
		ghostscript-5.50pc.tar.gz (PC executables and run-time files)
		ghostscript-5.50libpng.tar.gz (libpng 1.0.2)
		ghostscript-5.50zlib.tar.gz (zlib 1.1.3)
		ghostscript-5.50jpeg.tar.gz (IJG JPEG 6b)
		ghostscript-5.50gnu.tar.gz (a few GNU-licensed drivers)
</PRE>[plus the following that are identical to their 5.03 counterparts:]<PRE>
		ghostscript-fonts-std-5.50.tar.gz@
		ghostscript-fonts-other-5.50.tar.gz@
</PRE>
ZIP files for PC platforms are not available yet.  However, since all the
files needed to run on PCs are in the pc.tar.gz archive, you might consider
getting MS-DOS versions of gzip and tar, both of which are available free.
<P>
The most significant change in this release is that thanks to a volunteer,
all of the Ghostscript documentation is now in HTML.
<P>
This release was intended to complete the Display PostScript functionality
of Ghostscript.  Unfortunately, a commercial project unrelated to
Ghostscript consumed so much of our development time that we were only able
to implement a subset of the remaining Display PostScript functionality.  We
did implement a number of PostScript LanguageLevel 3 features, as well as
nearly all of the Adobe Acrobat Distiller-like image compression facilities.
<P>
Please report problems in the 5.50 release by e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:ghost@aladdin.com">&lt;ghost@aladdin.com&gt;</A>
using the Bug-form.htm reporting form that you will find in the Ghostscript
fileset.  We don't promise to investigate every problem, but if you provide
us with a fully filled-out reporting form, the chances are much better that
we will look into it.
<P>
Aladdin is committed to continuing the development of Ghostscript as a fully
competitive commercial-quality product as well as an unsupported, freely
redistributable package for end users.  If you are, or you know someone who
might be, a hardware, software, or system OEM interested in licensing
Ghostscript for incorporation in a commercial product (either embedded or
host-based), please contact our exclusive licensing partner, Artifex
Software Inc., at
<A HREF="mailto:info@artifex.com">&lt;info@artifex.com&gt;</A>.
