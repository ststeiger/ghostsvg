Artifex Software Inc. and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the
release of Ghostscript 8.00, the most comprehensive software solution
for page description languages. Ghostscript is a leader in PDF,
PostScript, and PCL technologies. Ghostscript 8.00 features the
following new capabilities:

<blockquote>
<p> <b>DeviceN color</b>

<p> With the 8.00 release, Ghostscript now offers true DeviceN color space
support, natively rendering spot colors, multicolor images, and gradient
effects up to 8 color planes. DeviceN also affords direct and precise
control over ink balances in large format inkjet devices. Ghostscript
currently powers inkjet RIPs from Best Color GmbH, Xerox XES (in
partnership with Caldera Graphics), MacDermid/ColorSpan, and Mutoh
America.

<p> <b>Spot color</b>

<p> Ghostscript 8.00 fully supports spot colors and Separation color spaces.
This functionality is actually a subset of DeviceN color spaces, and
hasa high performance implementation.

<p> <b>Overprint</b>

<p> Ghostscript 8.00 also brings native rendering of overprint and overprint
mode, as specified in PDF 1.3, and PostScript LanguageLevel 3. Thus,
Ghostscript's power and efficiency is now brought to new domains,
including packaging, high end prepress, and others.

<p> <b>Well Tempered Screening</b>

<p> Integration of "Well Tempered Screening", an imagesetter-optimized
screening technology from artofcode LLC. WTS produces exact irrational
angles, as opposed to the rational supercell approximation common in
most competitive RIPs. Dots are exceptionally smooth, even at relatively
high rulings and low resolutions. Screener-induced
(internal) moire is virtually eliminated. In addition, the WTS
integration provides significantly higher throughput when rendering
precise color angles than previous Ghostscript releases.

<p> <b>DiskN</b>

<p> Ghostscript now implements DiskN file resources within PostScript,
significantly improving the integration with font downloading utilities.
