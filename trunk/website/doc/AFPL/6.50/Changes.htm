Final News and change history edits in preparation for the 6.50 release.
Note that, with this commit, History6.htm has been cleaned up, deleting
commit messages for the HEAD branch in CVS incorrectly generated by
cvs2hist.py. (doc/Changes.htm [1.18.2.3], doc/History6.htm [1.14.2.6],

        - The OS/2 platform code would no longer compile, because the stdio
files are no longer available. (fix from rjl) (fix corresponds to revs
os2mak 1.9, gp_os2.c 1.5) (os2.mak [1.8.2.1]: 2000/12/05 01:31:15 raph)

Changes AROOTDIR from c:/Aladdin to c:/gs for Windows and OS/2 builds.

Fixes problems:
	- pdfopt.ps used the "unresolved?" procedure from pdf_base.ps, which
has been replaced by the slightly different "resolved?" procedure. (fix by
ghost@aladdin.com corresponds to rev 1.4) (lib/pdfopt.ps [1.3.2.1]:
2000/12/01 05:48:45 rayjj)

        - The OS/2 platform code would no longer compile, because the stdio
files are no longer available. (fix from rjl) (fix corresponds to revs
os2mak 1.9, gp_os2.c 1.5) (gp_os2.c [1.4.2.1]: 2000/12/05 01:31:14 raph)

Fixes problems:

The published PDF specification says the Encoding name "must be" one of the
3 predefined Encodings, implying that an error should occur if it isn't.
However, Acrobat Reader simply ignores unknown names, and since there are
some buggy applications that rely on this, we do the same.
(lib/pdf_font.ps [1.12.2.2]: 2000/11/28 19:03:16 alexcher)

</pre><h2><a name="6.50 Interpreter"></a>Interpreter</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- In dictionaries, an int lookup key sometimes didn't match a real
stored key, and vice versa. Fixes SourceForge bug # 123678. (fix by ghost@
aladdin.com corresponds to rev 1.3) (idict.c [1.2.2.1]: 2000/11/30 18:30:25
rayjj)
	- When closing an encoding filter pipeline with an eventual
procedure target, the intermediate 'process' procedures could be called even
after they returned EOFC, producing extraneous output. (zfproc.c [1.4.2.3]:
2000/12/02 06:15:14 raph)
	- Further tweaking of the logic to clear end_status flags in a
pipeline in the continuation of a procedure write, making it more aggressive
than the previous fix, but less aggressive than the original code. This is a
revised fix for Sourceforge bug 119777. (zfproc.c [1.4.2.4]: 2000/12/02
19:55:31 raph)
	- 'gstate' was allowed in global VM even if the current graphics
state included references to structures in local VM (which is, in fact,
normally the case) and the save level was non-zero: this could create a
dangling pointer after the 'restore'. This "fix" is a workaround that simply
prohibits doing this, but a correct fix would copy any such structures. (fix
by ghost@aladdin.com corresponds to rev 1.3) (zdps1.c [1.2.2.1]: 2000/12/02
21:08:27 raph)
	- The first call of check_psc_function in gs_build_function_4 didn't
initialize size to 0, causing the computed value of size to be garbage,
possibly leading to a VMerror or memory corruption. (zfunc4.c [1.5.2.2]:
2000/12/03 17:08:32 alexcher)

Version number updates in preparation for the 6.50 release.
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.25.2.3]: 2000/12/02 22:15:11 raph)

</pre><h2><a name="6.50 Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Allocates graphics state path in stable memory. This prevents
paths in Type 3 fonts allocated inside a save ... setcachedevice ... restore
sequence from being prematurely freed. Fixes SourceForge bug 101549.
(gspath1.c [1.2.2.1], gsstate.c [1.5.2.1]: 2000/12/04 21:10:27 raph)
        - An inadvertent change caused the graphics state not to be freed on
grestore. This fix, due to lpd, restores the freeing statement.
(gsstate.c [1.5.2.2]: 2000/12/05 09:12:04 raph)

Implements the stopgap measure of increasing fill_adjust for Coons patch
shading, to cover the dropouts caused by incorrect triangulation of the mesh
surface. See SourceForge Bug 119588 for a more thorough analysis.
(gsptype2.c [1.3.2.1], gxshade4.c [1.3.2.1]: 2000/11/29 01:29:50 raph)

The old code did not comply ISO/IEC C language standard and compiled wrongly
to Mac, causing halftone problem on Mac. (gshtscr.c [1.3.2.2]: 2000/11/29
14:38:00 igorm)

Version number updates in preparation for the 6.50 release.
(gscdef.c [1.9.2.1]: 2000/12/02 22:15:11 raph)
