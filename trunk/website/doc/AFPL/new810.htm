<hr>

<p>
Artifex Software, Inc and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the availability of Ghostscript 8.10 beta.
The 8.10 beta release is an incremental release from 8.00. It contains
some fairly substantial reworking of important modules, most notably
in the font rendering. Because of the extent of the changes, we're
labelling this as a beta release. It should be quite usable, but
it hasn't been as thoroughly wrung out as our production releases.
<blockquote>
<p>
The major new feature improved font rendering by Igor Melichev. The
new font renderer prevents dropouts intelligently rather than relying
on "fill_adjust" (which has the side effect of making the font
bolder).
<p>
In addition, pdfwrite continues to evolve and improve. Most patterns
and type 3 fonts are now output as high-level objects rather 
than being rasterized.
<p>
This is our first release with support for JBIG2 encoded images, using
our jbig2dec library. This decoder is not yet complete, but
successfully decodes many PDF files containing JBIG2 images.
<p>
This release also contains an important security fix. If you are using
Ghostscript in a security-critical application, we recommend you
upgrade now.
<p>
Finally, we include the usual bug fixes and improvements. Please
exercise this release thoroughly, so we can make the next release
rock-solid.
