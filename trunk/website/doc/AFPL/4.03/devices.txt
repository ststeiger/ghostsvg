### ------------------------- The SPARCprinter ------------------------- ###

This section was written by Martin Schulte.

Introduction
------------

The SPARCprinter is is connected to SPARCStation via a special SBUS card's
video inferface, the picture is composed on the host and only a bitmap is
send to the printer unit.

Together with a SPARCprinter, you always buy (as far as I know) software
that enables you to do postscript-printing on your SPARCPrinter.

So, the need for a Ghostscript-Interface to the SPARCPrinter seems low,
but on the other hand some Postscript drawings are not correctly printed
with SUN's software: on some pages occured a thin vertical line of rubbish
(reproducable), on some Mathematica drawings the text at the axes wasn't
rotated.

I tried all of these with Ghostscript and always got the expected results.

However, replacing proprietary software should never be a bad idea.

The problem is that there has yet been no effort to make the SPARCPrinter-
driver behave like a BSD output-filter, I made my tests using the script
mentioned under Installation.

Installation
------------

Add sparc.dev to DEVICE_DEVS and compile ghostscript as described in
make.txt.

Afterwards, you can use the following script (the way of handling standard
input versus filename-arguments doesn't look very clever, has anyone a
better idea ?) to print if you substitute <GSPATH> by the place where you
installed the ghostscript binary:

outcmd1='/vol/local/lib/troff2/psxlate -r'
outcmd2='<GSPATH> -I/home/schulte/gs252 -sDEVICE=sparc -sOUTPUTFILE=/dev/lpvi0 -'

if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
  $outcmd1 | $outcmd2
else
  cat $* | $outcmd1 | $outcmd2
fi

Problems
--------

Since /dev/lpvi can only be opened for exclusive use, another job having
opened it (engine_ctl_sparc or another ghostscript as the most probable
canidates) will cause to stop ghostscript with "Error: /invalidfileaccess
in --.outputpage--"

In case of common printer problems like out of paper, a warning describing
the reason will be printed to stdout, the driver will try to access again
and again each five seconds.

Due to a problem with the device-driver (in the kernel) the reason of
printer failure is not always correctly reported to program.  This is the
case at least if you open the top cover (Error in the display: E5).  Look
to the display at the printer if a "Printer problem with unknown reason"
is reported.

Fatal errors will cause the print-job to be terminated.

Information and tips on usage for the drivers contained in gdevcdj.c
====================================================================

OVERVIEW:

There are 6 generic drivers contained in the source module:

     1 - cdj500:      HP DeskJet 500C and 540C
     2 - cdj550:      HP DeskJet 550C and 560C
     3 - pjxl300:     HP PaintJet XL300 and DeskJet 1200C
     4 - pjtest:      HP PaintJet
     5 - pjxltest:    HP PaintJet XL
     6 - declj250:    DEC LJ250

 All of these drivers have 8-bit (monochrome), 16-bit and 24-bit
     (colour) and for the DJ 550C 32-bit, (colour, cmyk mode)
     options in addition to standard colour and mono drivers.
 It is also possible to set various printer-specific parameters
     from the gs command line, eg.

  gs -sDEVICE=cdeskjet -dBitsPerPixel=16 -dDepletion=1 -dShingling=2 tiger.ps

NB/ The old names cdeskjet, cdjcolor and cdjmono drivers have been retained;
    however, their functionality duplicates that available using the above
    drivers (and cdeskjet is identical to cdj500), ie. we can use:

	gs -sDEVICE=cdj500 -dBitsPerPixel=24 ...	for cdjcolor, and
	gs -sDEVICE=cdj500 -dBitsPerPixel=1  ...	for cdjmono


DEFAULT PAPER SIZE:

 If the preprocessor symbol A4 is defined, the default paper size is the
 European A4 size; otherwise it is the U.S. letter size (8.5"x11"). Other
 paper sizes (including A3 for the PaintJet XL and PaintJet XL300) may be
 specified on the command line as explained in the Ghostscript documentation.


DEFAULT BITS-PER-PIXEL:

 If the preprocessor symbol BITSPERPIXEL is defined as an integer (see below
 for the range of allowable values), this number will be used to define the
 default bits-per-pixel (ie. bit depth) for the generic drivers. If the
 symbol is not defined, the default is set to 24 bits per pixel. It is
 of course still possible to specify the value from the command line, as
 described below. Note also that the cdeskjet, cdjcolor and cdjmono
 drivers are unaffected by setting this symbol, as their default settings
 are predefined to be 1, 3 and 24 respectively.


DESKJET PHYSICAL LIMITS:

 Maximum printing width = 2400 dots = 8". The printer manuals say that the
 maximum recommended printing height on the page is 10.3", but since this
 is obviously not true for A4 paper, and I have been unable to detect any
 problems in printing longer page lengths, this would seem to be a rather
 artificial restriction.

 All Deskjets have 1/2" unprintable bottom margin, due to the mechanical
 arrangement used to grab the paper. Side margins are approximately 0.25"
 for US Letter paper, and 0.15" for A4.


COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS:

 Several printer 'properties' have been implemented for these printers.
 Those available so far are all integer quantities, and thus may be
 specified as eg.

	gs -dBitsPerPixel=32 -dShingling=1 ... 

 which sets the BitsPerPixel parameter to 32 and the Shingling parameter
 to 1.


BITS-PER-PIXEL:

 All of the drivers in gdevcdj.c accept a command line option to set the
 BitsPerPixel property. This gives considerable flexibility in choosing
 various trade-offs between speed/quality/colour etc. The valid numbers
 are:

	1:	This is a standard Ghostscript monochrome driver, and uses
		black ink (by installing the separate mono cartridge in
		the case of the DeskJet 500C, or automatically for the
		other printers)

	3:	A standard Ghostscript colour driver, using internal
		dithering. This is fast to compute and to print, but
		the clustered dithering can lose some detail and
		colour fidelity.

	8:	An 'error-diffusion' monochrome driver which uses
		Floyd-Steinberg dithering to print greyscale images.
		The patterns are much more randomised than with the
		normal clustered dithering, but the data files can
		be much larger and somewhat slower to print.

	16:	This is a 'cheaper' version of the following (24-bit)
		driver, which generates a Floyd-Steinberg colour dithered
		output using the minimum amount of memory (this may be
		helpful when using IBM PC's when Ghostscript has not
		been compiled using a 32-bit 386-style compiler). The
		quality can be almost as good as the 24-bit version.

	24:	A high-quality colour driver using Floyd-Steinberg dithering
		for maximum detail and colour range. However it is very
		memory intensive and thus can be slow to compute (and it
		tends to produce rather larger raw data files, so they
		can also be slower to print).

	32:	This is for the DeskJet 550C only, which uses the black
		cartridge and the colour cartridge simultaneously (ie.
		CMYK printing). This printer can be both faster and give
		higher quality than the DeskJet 500C, because of the
		true black ink. (Note that the 24-bit mode also permits
		CMYK printing on this printer, and uses less memory. Any
		differences between 24-bit and 32-bit should be very small.)


DESKJET PROPERTIES:

 The addional properties available for the DeskJets are:

	BlackCorrect	(int)	  /* Colour correction to give
				   * better blacks when using the DJ500C
				   * in colour mode, eg. the default of 4
				   * reduces the cyan component to 4/5 
				   * Range accepted: 0 - 9 (0 = none) */
	Shingling	(int)	  /* Interlaced, multi-pass printing 
	                           * 0 = none, 1 = 50%, 2 = 25%, 2 is
				   * best & slowest */
	Depletion	(int)	  /* 'Intelligent' dot-removal 
		                   * 0 = none, 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%, 1 best
				   * for graphics? 
				   * Use 0 for transparencies */

PAINTJET XL300/PAINTJET XL PROPERTIES:

	PrintQuality	(int)	  /* Mechanical print quality
				   * -1 = fast, 0 = normal, 1 = presentation
				   * Fast mode reduces ink usage and uses
				   * single-pass operation for some media
				   * types. Presentation uses more ink and
				   * max number of passes, ie. slowest
				   * printing for highest quality */
	RenderType	(int)	  /* 0 = driver does dithering
				   * 1 = snap to primaries
				   * 2 = snap black -> white, others to black
				   * 3 = ordered dither
				   * 4 = error diffusion
				   * 5 = monochrome ordered dither
				   * 6 = monochrome error diffusion
				   * 7 = cluster ordered dither
				   * 8 = monochrome cluster ordered dither
				   * 9 = user-defined dither (not supported)
				   * 10 = monochrome user-defined dither ns. */

PAINTJET PROPERTIES:

	No additional properties


GAMMA CORRECTION:

 One consequence of using Floyd-Steinberg dithering rather than Ghostscript's
 default clustered ordered dither is that it is much more obvious that the
 ink dots are rather larger on the page than their nominal 1/180" or 1/300"
 size (clustering the dots tends to minimise this effect). Thus it is often
 the case that the printed result is rather too dark. A simple empirical
 correction for this may be achieved by preceding the actual postscript
 file to be printed by a short file which effectively sets the gamma for
 the device, eg.

 gs ... gamma.ps colorpic.ps -c quit

 where gamma.ps is

%!
{0.333 exp} dup dup currenttransfer setcolortransfer

 This example sets the gamma for r, g, and b to 3, which seems to work
 reasonably well in practice.


GENERAL TIPS:

 For all the above printers, the paper is critically important to the 
 final results. Smoother, less fibrous paper is generally better (and
 suggested types are given in the printer manuals). In particular, the
 special ink-jet paper can make a big difference; the colours are 
 brighter, but most importantly, there is almost no colour bleed, even 
 with adjacent areas of very heavy inking. Similarly, the special coated
 transparencies also work well (and ordinary transparencies do not work
 at all!)

 The unix-lpr.sh provides one example of setting up a multi-option
 colour postscript lpr queue on Unix systems, and includes the ability
 to choose a range of different colour options and printer accounting
 and error logging.


CAVEAT EMPTOR!:

 It is not always easy for me to test all of these drivers, as the only
 colour printer I have here is the DeskJet 500C. I rely on others testing
 drivers for the additional machines and reporting their findings back to
 me. 

HP's 600x300 dpi resolution-enhanced mode for inkjet printers
=============================================================

This feature is available on HP's more recent inkjet printers,
including the Deskjet 520 (mono) 540 (mono or colour) and 560C (mono
and colour).

The colour and monochrome drivers for the HP deskjet 550c are
(probably) the best you will get for use with ghostscript, for the
following reasons:

These printers do not offer true 600x300 dpi resolution. Those that
print in colour are strictly 300x300 dpi in colour mode, while in mono
mode there is a pseudo 600x300 dot mode, with the restriction that you
can't print two adjacent dots. Thus, in effect what you have is 600 dpi
dot positioning, but on average you don't get more dots per line.

What this does give is the possibility to have eg. sharper character
outlines, as you can place dots on the edges nearer to their ideal
positions - this is why it is worth doing.

However, HP will not support user-level programming of this
resolution-enhanced mode, one reason being that (I understand) all the
dot spacing has to be done by the driver, and if you get it wrong, you
can actually damage the print head.

To summarise, you may lose a smidgin of (potential) text clarity using
the 550c drivers (cdj550, cdjcolor, cdjmono etc.), but other than that,
they are the ones for the job.

### ------------------- Apple Dot Matrix Printer  ---------------------- ###

This section was written by Mark Wedel.

 The Dot Matrix Driver (DMP) driver is a simple driver I wrote.  It
could more more efficient, but it seems to print the images fine.

 The Dot Matrix Printer was a parallel predecessor to the Imagewriter
printer.  As far as I know, the Imagewriter commands are a superset
to those of the Dot Matrix printer, so the driver should work fine at
generating output that can be printed on Imagewriters.

 A few notes (from the gdevadmp.c file):

 * To print out images, it sets the printer for unidirection printing
 * and 15 cpi (120 dpi). IT sets line feed to 1/9 of an inch (72 dpi).
 * When finished, it sets things back to bidirection print, 1/8" line
 * feeds, and 12 cpi.  There does not appear to be a way to reset
 * things to initial values.
 *
 * This code does not set for 8 bit characters (which is required). It
 * also assumes that carriage return/newline is needed, and not just
 * carriage return.  These are all switch settings on the DMP, and
 * I have configured them for 8 bit data and cr only.
 *
 * You can search for the strings Init and Reset (in devdemp.c) to find the
 * strings that set up the printer and clear things when finished, and change
 * them to meet your needs.
 *
 * Also, you need to make sure that the printer daemon (assuming unix)
 * doesn't change the data as it is being printed.  I have set my
 * printcap file (sunos 4.1.1) with the string:
 * ms=pass8,-opost
 * and it works fine.

### ------------------ The Epson Stylus Color printer ------------------ ###
/*
 Epson Stylus-Color Driver, contributed by Gunther Hess (address: see below)

I N T R O D U C T I O N
=======================
This documentation accompanies version 1.90 of the stcolor-driver.
Compared to version 1.21 (gs3.53) there are just a few, but somehow
important chages:

 - Default: noWeave escpBand=1 (-> default works with all known models)
 - added Parameter "Softweave" (useful only with Original STC and PRO-Series)
 - added Compile-Option (-DSTC_SIGNAL) to catch interrupts during printing
   (thanks to Frederic Loyer)
 - compatibility with ansi2knr
 - compatibility with 64Bit Processors
 - clarification of usage with Pro-XL and Stylus Color II

A Note on the Version-Numbering: Version 1.xx comes to it's end. 
Any 1.xx > 1.90 will have only Bug-Fixes. Maybe that Version 2.xx
comes to life, if this is the case it will include full support of
the newer models.

U S A G E
=========
This driver is selected with "-sDEVICE=stcolor" and produces output for an
Epson Stylus-Color at 360DpI resolution by default, but it can do much
more with this printer and with significantly better quality, than with
the default-mode and it can also produce code for the monochrome-versions
of this printer.

This can be achieved either via command-line options or via ghostscript-input.
For convienience a Postscript-File is supplied, that can be used as initial
inputfile. Thus, assumed that ghostscript is invoked via "gs" on your computer,
try the following command:

    gs -sDEVICE=stcolor -rXDPIxYDPI stcolor.ps ... (e.g.: your input-files)

were XDPI is one of 180/360/720 and YDPI is one of (90/)180/360/720. The result
should be significantly better, you may use "stcolor.ps" with other devices
too, but I do not recommend this, since it does nothing then. "stcolor.ps"
should be available with binary distributions and should reside in the
ghostscript input-directory. Thus if ghostscript is part of your
printer-spooler, you can insert

    (stcolor.ps) findlibfile { pop run } if pop

to the files you want to run through the improved algorithms and you may want
to adapt this file to your specific needs. The methods and options for this
are described here, but this description is restricted to the gs-options, while
their manipulation at the Postscript-level is documented in "language.txt" and
in the mentioned "stcolor.ps".

Next thing is to explain the options (as written on my unix-system).
The order is somehow related to their use during the printing-Process:

  -dUnidirectional      - Force unidirectional printing,
                          recommended for transparencies

  -dMicroweave          - enable the printers "microweave"-feature.
  -dnoWeave             - disable any Weaving, overrides -dMicroweave
  -dSoftweave           - enable internal weaving of the driver.

*   Weave-Note: Softweave works *ONLY* with the original Stylus-Color
*               and the PRO-Series. 

  -sDithering="name"    - select another dithering-algorithm, available are:
              "gscmyk"    : fast color-output, with CMYK-ProcessColorModel [D]
              "gsmono"    : fast black & white output
              "gsrgb"     : fast color-output, with RGB-ProcessColorModel
              "fsmono"    : Floyd-Steinberg, Monochrome
              "fsrgb"     : Floyd-Steinberg, with RGB-ProcessColorModel
                            (Almost identical to cdj550/mjcxxx-Algorithm)
              "fsx4"      : Floyd-Steinberg, with CMYK-ProcessColorModel
                            (shares code with fsmono & fsrgb, but is
                             algorithmically really bad)
              "fscmyk"    : Floyd-Steinberg, with CMYK-ProcessColorModel
                            and proper modifications for CMYK
              "hscmyk"    : modified Floyd-Steinberg with CMYK-Model
                            ("hs" stands for "hess" nor for "high speed",
                             but the major difference to "fscmyk" is speed)
              "fs2"       : algorithm by Steven Singer (RGB)
                            should be identical to escp2cfs2.

 -dBitsPerPixel=1...32    - number of bits used for pixel-storage, the larger
                            the value, the better the quality - at least in
                            theory. In fsrgb one can gain some speed, when
                            restricting to 24 Bits, rather than the default
                            of 30.

 -dFlag0                  - causes some algorithms to select a uniform
                            initialisation rather than a set of random-values.
                            May yield "sharper" image-impression at the
                            cost of "dithering-atrefacts".
                            (applies to hscmyk and all fs-modi, except for fs2,
                             which always uses a constant initialization.)

 -dFlag1 ... -dFlag4      - available to future algorithms.

 -dColorAdjustMatrix={3/9/16 x float}'
                          - This is a Matrix to adjust the colors. Values should
                            be between -1.0 and 1.0, and the number of
                            values depend on the colormodel used by the
                            selected algorithm. In RGB- and CMYK-modi a matrix
                            with 1.0 on the diagonal produces no transformation.
                            (I could not identify a similar feature at the
                            language-level, so this option was implemented, it
                            is really required, but I don't know reasonable
                            values yet.)

 -dCtransfer='{float float ...}', -dMtransfer=..., -dY..., -dK... or
 -dRtransfer='{float float ...}', -dG..., -dB... or
 -dKtransfer='{float float ...}'
                          - which is used, depends on the algorithm, which
                            maybe either either CMYK, RGB or monochrome.
                            The values are arrays of floats in the range from
                            0 to 1.0, which represent the visible
                            color-intensity for the device. One may achieve
                            similar effects with "setcolortransfer" at the
                            language-level, but this takes more time and the
                            underlying-code for the driver-specific parameters
                            is still required. The size of the arrays is
                            arbitrary and the defaults are {0.0 1.0}, which
                            is a linear characteristic, most of the code in
                            "stcolor.ps" are better transfer-arrays.

 -dKcoding='{float...}', -dC..., -dM... etc.
                          - this are again arrays between 0.0 and 1.0, and
                            they control the internal coding of the
                            color-values. Clever usage of this arrays may
                            yield further enhancements, but no experience yet.
                            [To be discontinued with version >= 2.x]

 -sModel=st800            - causes output to be suitable for the monochrome
                            Stylus 800 (no Weaving, no Color).

 -sOutputCode=            - can be either "plain", "runlength" or "deltarow"
                            and changes the ESC/P2 (TM) coding-technique used
                            by the driver. The default is to use the
                            runlength-encoding. "plain" selects uncompressed
                            encoding and yields enormeous amounts of data to
                            generated.

 -descp_Band=1/8/15/24    - Number of Nozzles of scanlines used in printing.
                            Useful only with -dnoWeave. Larger Values yield

A P P L I C A T I O N  - N O T E
================================

Quite a bunch of Parameters. Hopefully you never need any of them, besides
feeding "stcolor.ps" to ghostscript in front of your input.

After answering some questions over 50 Times, I prepared a STC-FAQ-Collection.
I am currently unable offer this FAQ on the net.
But thanks to Bill Davidson it is available as:

    http://www.isisnet.com/bdavidson/gs_stc.FAQ.html

And here it comes (as plain text):

VERSION:
This FAQ refers to ghostscript > 3.50 with stcolor > 1.20. The former 
release (ghostscript-3.33/stcolor-1.12) used different parameters and 
had some severe bugs. This FAQ is itself version 1.3.

TOPIC: Pro XL?
Yes, this driver supports the A3-Size Printer. Simply set the required
pagesize and margins. A simple way to do this, is to specify the
parameter "-sPAPERSIZE=a3" on the commandline or to include the
procedure-call "a3" in the postscript-Prolog section. If you want
to optimize the printable area and/or set the proper Margins, see
topic Margins, PageSize.

TOPIC: Margins, PageSize
Different than other drivers, i refuse to add code to the stcolor-driver,
that tries to guess the proper margins or pagesize. This is due to the
fact, that i found that such guessing is usually wrong and needs correction
either in the source or the parameters. The following code can be
inserted to "stcolor.ps" after the line:

     mark % prepare stack for "putdeviceprops"

And this is the new code:

/.HWMargins [9.0 39.96 12.6 9.0]     % Left, Bottom, Right, Top (1/72")
/PageSize   [597.6 842.4]            % Paper, including Marings (1/72")
/Margins [ % neg. Offset to Left/Top in Pixels
   4 index 0 get STCold /HWResolution get 0 get mul 72 div neg
   5 index 3 get STCold /HWResolution get 1 get mul 72 div neg
]

Feel free to change the Values for ".HWMargins" and "PageSize" to match
your needs. The given Values are the defaults from the driver, when 
compiled with "-DA4" set.

This Option -or it's omission- may cause trouble: The Stylus Color can 
print exactly 8" or 2880Pixel@360DpI. The remaining paper is the
margin, where the left margin varies only slightly with the papersize,
while the right margin ist significantly increased for wider paper,
such as letter.

-> If you are using stcolor > 1.20, compiled without "-DA4", on european
   paper, then the Default-Margin is too large. You need to add the 
   proper ".HWMargins" to the commandline or stolor.ps


TOPIC: Stylus Color II / IIs and 1500.
First the good news: The driver can print on the Stylus Color II.
And the bad ones:
- According to Epson-Support the driver "abuses" the color-capabilities.
  (See topic "Future Plans" for details.)
- You need some parameters on the command-line (or in stcolor.ps).
- I doubted that it would be usable with the Stylus Color IIs.
  *BUT* it is usable and suffers from the mixing-Problems!!.

To make thinks work, you *MUST* disable the drivers internal 
weaving ("Softweave"). This can be done in two ways:

       gs .... -dMicroweave ....

or
       gs ... -dnoWeave -descp_Band=1 ....

[1.90 fixes this "bug" due to a changed default-behaviour]

I experienced significantly increased printing speed with the second
variant on the old Stylus Color, when printing mostly monochrome data.

TOPIC: Future Plans
Actually i thought, that the driver is finished by now, but an answer
from Epson triggered future development. This was the answer from
Epson-Support:

To: Klaus-Gunther Hess
Subject: Help: Need Programming Info for Stylus-(Color)-Printers

The differentiation is necessary, as the printers produce the graphics
differently.  To wit:

  CMY Class - ( Stylus Color IIs ) The Stylus Color IIs prints color
  graphics with the three different color inks (cyan, magenta, and yellow).
  Also, black is printed using composit black (mixture of CMY).  For high
  quality laser like black,  a separate black ink cartridge should be used.

  CMY + K Class - ( Stylus Color II )  This printer has both a CMY and a
  black ink (K)  cartridge installed at the same time.  However, due to the
  nature of the black ink it can not be mixed or overlaid with the color
  inks.  Therefore, when black is needed, composite black is used.
  If the image calls for pure black (e.g., text), the black cartridge is used.

  CMYK Class - ( Stylus Color, Stylus Pro and Pro XL )  These printers
  have a mixable black (K) ink.  This ink is compatible with the CMY inks
  and will not bleed when combined or printed next to the CMY inks.

Bruce U.
The Epson Connection 

Thus I am working on a version, that supports CMY and CMY + K dithering.
Actually there are also some new (*undocumented*) instructions used by
the windows-driver in conjunction withe the Stylus Color II/IIs, that
raises the need for some more "escp_*" Parameters.

=============================

The next section is a contribution from Jason Patterson <jason@reflections.com.au>
who evaluated a previous version (1.17). GhostScript was invoked as follows:

   gs -sDEVICE=stcolor [-r720x720] -sDithering=... -sOutputFile=escp.out \
      stcolor.ps whatsoever.ps

where "..." is the name of the desired algorithm. "stcolor.ps" was omitted
for the gs-algorithms (gsmono, gsrgb and gscmyk), for which it is useless
*and* it would not allow the selection of "gscmyk".

So here comes a very truncated version of Jasons text:

             COLOR DITHERING EXPERIMENTS with gdevstc-1.21
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's a bit of feedback about the EPSON Stylus Color driver's different
dithering methods, based on a little experiment using 4 good quality
scanned images of quite varied nature.

Here is a summary of the results of the four experiments...


 gsmono: Pretty much what you'd expect from a mono ordered pattern. Looks
         like what a lot of mono laser printers produce.

 fsmono: Excellent for monochrome.

 gscmyk: Not very good, but then you'd expect that from an ordered pattern.

 gsrgb:  A little better than gscmyk. More consistent looking.

 fs2:    Good, but not quite as good as fsrgb. Gets the brightness wrong,
         too light at 720dpi, too dark at 360dpi.

 fsrgb:  Very good, but a little too dark and has a slight blue tint.

 hscmyk: Excellent. Slightly better than fsrgb and fs2. Better than fscmyk on
         some images, almost the same on most.

 fscmyk: Best. Very, *very* slightly better than hscmyk. On some images,
         nearly as good as the EPSON demos (which were done with the
         MS-Windows driver). 

 Overall Visual Quality (out of ten):

  gsmono |*********
  fsmono |*****************
         |
  gscmyk |********
  gsrgb  |*********
  fs2    |****************
  fsrgb  |*****************
  hscmyk |******************
  fscmyk |******************
         +---------------------
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

 best-to-worst order:  color: fscmyk hscmyk fsrgb fs2 gsrgb gscmyk
                        mono: fsmono gsmono


SANITY NOTE: The above results are only from *four* images, a total of 24
             printouts (8 on 720dpi paper, 16 on plain paper). Your results
             will almost certainly vary, and your standards might not be
             the same as mine, so use these results as a *guide* only, not
             as a formal evaluation.

C O L O R - T R A N S F O R M A T I O N
=======================================

*NOTE*: Things are changing with version gdevstc > 2.00!

In the initial version of the driver, distributed with Ghostscript-3.33,
the parameter "SpotSize" was the only way to manipulate the colors at the
driver-level. According to the parameters enumerated above, this has changed
significantly with version 1.16 and above. This is the result of
an ongoing discussion about dithering-algorithms and "false color" on the
Epson-Stylus-Color. This initiated the transformation of the stcolor-driver
into a framework for different dithering-algorithms, that provides a generalized
interface to the internal Ghostscript-Color-Models and the other data-structures
related to Ghostscript-Drivers.

The main thing such a framework should be able to do is to deliver the
values the dithering-algorithm needs and since this influences directly
the optical image impression, this transformation should be adjustable without
the need for recompilation and relinking.

In general the process can be described as follows:

   ColorAdjustMatrix   Coding                    Transfer
 +---------------------+    +---------------------+    +------------------+
 |  Ghostscript  Color |    | Ghostscript  Raster |    | Dithering  Data  |
 |                     | => | 1/2/4/8/16/24/32Bit | => |   1/3/4x Values  |
 |  1/3/4x16Bit Values |    | for all components  |    | (arbitrary type) |
 +---------------------+    +---------------------+    +------------------+

Due to the limitations on raster-storage, information is lost in the first
transformation step, except for the 16Bit Monochrome-Mode. So any color
adjustment should take place before this step and this is where the optional
ColorAdjustMatrix works.

The first transformation-step is called "coding" and is controlled by the
?coding-Arrays. The Decoding-process expands the range of values
pontentially to a larger range than that provided by the initial ghostscript
color-model. It is therefore a reasonable place to make device- and/or
algorithm-specific adjustments. This is the place where the ?transfer-Arrays
are used. Array-Access might be not the fastest method, but its generality
is superior, so this step is always based upon internaly algorithm-specific
array-access. If 8Bits are stored per color-component and if the algorithm
uses bytes too, the second transformation is included within the first, what
saves significant computation-time when printing the data.


ColorAdjustMatrix
-----------------

The driver supports different "ProcessColorModel"-Values, which raises the
need for different color-adjustments. In the following "CAM" stands for
ColorAdjustMatrix:

   DeviceGray: (3 Floats):
      if((r == g) && (g == b))
         K' = 1.0 - R;
      else
         K' = 1.0 - CAM[0] * R + CAM[1] * G + CAM[2] * B;

      According to the documentation in drivers.txt, the latter should
      never happen.

   DeviceRGB: (9 Floats)
      if((r == g) && (g == b))
         R' = B' = G' = R;
      else
         R' = CAM[0]*R + CAM[1]*G + CAM[2]*B;
         G' = CAM[3]*R + CAM[4]*G + CAM[5]*B;
         B' = CAM[6]*R + CAM[7]*G + CAM[8]*B;

      The Printer uses always four inks, thus a special treatment of black
      is provided. Algorithms may take special action, if r==g==b. Maybe
      that in future versions Kcoding & Ktransfer become active in RGB-Mode.

   DeviceCMYK: (16 Floats)

      if((c == m) && (m == y))
         K' = max(C,K);
         C' = M' = Y' = 0;
      else
         K  = min(C,M,Y);
         if((K > 0) && ColorAdjustMatrix_present) { => UCR
            C -= K;
            M -= K;
            Y -= K;
         }

         C' = CAM[ 0]*C + CAM[ 1]*M + CAM[ 2]*Y + CAM[ 3]*K;
         M' = CAM[ 4]*C + CAM[ 5]*M + CAM[ 6]*Y + CAM[ 7]*K;
         Y' = CAM[ 8]*C + CAM[ 9]*M + CAM[10]*Y + CAM[11]*K;
         K' = CAM[12]*C + CAM[13]*M + CAM[14]*Y + CAM[15]*K;

      Again we have a special black-treatment. "max(C,K)" was introduced
      because of a slight misbehaviour of ghostscript, that delivers
      black under certain circumstances as (1,1,1,0). Normally, when
      no special "Black Seperation" and "Undercolor Removal" procedures
      are defined at the postscript-level, either (c,m,y,0) or (0,0,0,k)
      values are mapped. This would make the extended ColorAdjustMatrix
      quite tedious, thus during mapping black-seperartion is done for
      (c,m,y,0)-Requests and if there is a ColorAdjustMatrix, undercolor-
      removal is used too. In other words the Default-Matrix is:

                   1 0 0 1
                   0 1 0 1
                   0 0 1 1
                   0 0 0 1

       and it is applied to CMYK-Values with seperated and removed Black.
       Raising the CMY-Coefficients while lowering the K-coefficients
       reduces black and intensifies color. But be careful, even low
       deviations from the default cause drastic changes.

If no ColorAdjustMatrix is set, the matrix-computations are skipped. Thus
the transformation reduces to:

    - Range-Inversion in Monochrome-Mode
    - Black-Separation in CMYK-Mode


RGB/CMYK-coding & -transfer and BitsPerPixel
--------------------------------------------

This two (groups) of parameters are arrays of floatingpoint-numbers in the
range 0.0 to 1.0. They control the truncation to the desired number of
bits stored in the raster-memory (BitsPerPixel) and the ink-density.

The "truncation" may become a nonlinear-function, if any of the ?coding-arrays
are set. Assume the following Ghostscript invocation:

    gs -sDEVICE=stcolor -sDithering=fscmyk -dBitsPerPixel=16 \
       -dMcoding='{ 0.0 0.09 0.9 1.0 }' \
                                        -dYtransfer='{ 0.0 0.09 0.9 1.0 }' \
       -dKcoding='{ 0.0 0.09 0.9 1.0 }' -dKtransfer='{ 0.0 0.09 0.9 1.0 }' \

We may have ?coding and/or ?transfer, thus four combinations are possible
and this four combinations appear in the given example. The resulting mapping
is given in the following tables, where except for the internal Indices
(4 Components * 4 Bits = 16 BitsPerPixel), all values are normalized to the
Range 0-1. The actual range is 0 to 65535 for the ghostscript-color and
0 to 16777215 (2^24-1) for the ink-values delivered to the fscmyk-algorithm.
Sorry for the bunch of numbers following, but you may try this example in
conjunction with "stcinfo.ps", what should give you a graphical
printout of the following numbers, when you issue a "showpage"-command:

      0.933   0.875 - 0.937  14  0.933    0.715 - 0.889  14  0.778
      1.000   0.938 - 1.000  15  1.000    0.889 - 1.111  15  1.000

The difference between Cyan and Magenta is the presence of a Coding-Array.
The coding-process must map a range of color-values to each of the 16
component-indices. If no coding-array is given, this is accomplished
by a division with 4096 -equivalent to a right-shift by 12 Bits-. The
final ink-density resides in the given interval and moves form the left to
the right side from 0 to 15. In the Magenta-case, there is a coding array
and the ink-value matches the center of the intervals. But the distribution
of the mapped intervals follows the given Coding-Array and is nonlinear in
the linear color-space of ghostscript.

Now let us take a look at the case with Transfer-Arrays:

                           YELLOW                      BLACK

Yellow uses a transfer-array. There is no linear correspondence between
the color- and the ink-values. This correspondence is defined through the
given array. In other words: the Transfer-arrays define a nonlinear
ink-characteristic, what is exactly the same functionaltity, that
Postscripts "(color)transfer"-function provides.

While in the case of Yellow, the intervals match the intervals used with Cyan,
the inetervals used for Black match the Magenta-Intervals, but watch
the corespondence between the CI/15-values and the Ink-Density for Black:
This is a linear distribution in the Ink-domian.

Not a bad idea, I think. Consider the fs2-algorithm: It uses values in
the range 0-255 (Bytes). If any transfer-array would be supplied alone,
some of the 256 possible values would never be used and others will be
used for adjacent intervals several times. Establishing an identical
coding-array solves this problem, so that the full potential of the
algorithm is utilized.

Another useful feature of the coding-arrays is, that they are internally
normalized to the 0-1 Range. In the 720x720Dpi-Mode the transfer-arrays
in stcolor.ps limit the Dot-Density to about 50%, thus this arrays end
at 0.5 (respectively start at 0.5 in the RGB-case). Due to the automatic
normalization this arrays can be used as coding-arrays too. But of course
in the fs2-case mentioned above, values from 0-127 will never be deliverd
to the algorithm, while values 128-255 are delivered for adjacent intervals.

To clearify the intended use of the three parameters/parameter-groups the
following statements should be kept in mind:

- ColorAdjustMatrix is never used, when transferring gray-values. This
  restricts it to what the name says: Adjustment of Colors e.g. the
  correction for miscolored ink. Do not use it for staturation or
  brightness-control.

- ?transfer-arrays control the values delivered to the driver, which in
  turn controls the ink-quantity. This arrays should be used for control
  of saturation and brightness. Maybe that a Postscript-Header for the
  manipulation of brightness and so on will be provided with future
  versions. In general this arrays are identical for all inks.
  If they differ they provide a simpler scheme for color-correction,
  which is not necessarily faster than the ColorAdjustMatrix.

- ?coding-arrays control the color-value-intervals mapped to
  the internal color-indices.

P R I N T - M O D I
===================

The parameters "Unidirectional", "Microweave", "noWeave",
"OutputCode", "Model" and the given resolution provide control over the
data generated for the printer.

Unidirectional
--------------
Simply toggles the unidirectional-mode of the printer. Setting "Unidirectional"
definitly decreases printing-speed, but may increase the quality. I use
this for printing tranparencies, where fast head-movement could smear the ink.

Microweave, noWeave and OutputCode=deltarow
-------------------------------------------
The first are two Booleans, what immediatly tells, that 4 combinations are
possible. Actually only three exist (if you don't count for deltarow):

     1. Softweave
     2. Microweave
     3. noWeave

First and second are functionally identical, their difference is that either
the driver or the printer does the job. So the question

            What is weaving ?

arises. The Epson Stylus Color has a Head-Assembly that contains two physically
identifiable Heads. One for Black and one for Cyan/Magenta/Yellow. This
makes 4 logical Heads, one for each color-component. Each of this four heads
has several jets at some Y-distance, so several horizontal lines can be printed
during one pass of the heads. From the experience I think there are 15 Jets
per color spaced at 1/90".

So the question arises, how to print at a Y-Resolution of 360Dpi with this
90DpI-Jets. Simply by divison, one gets 360/90 = 4, what tells us, that
4 Passes of the head-assembly are required to achieve a Y-resolution of
360DpI. Weaving is just the scheme how the 15 jets are utilized to print
adjacent horizontal rows:

                    Weaving                   noWeave
    Pass:     1     2     3     4       1     2     3     4
    0/360"   jet0   -     -     -      jet0   -     -     -
    1/360"    -    jet1   -     -       -    jet0   -     -
    2/360"    -     -    jet2   -       -     -    jet0   -
    3/360"    -     -     -    jet3     -     -     -    jet0
    4/360"   jet1   -     -     -      jet1   -     -     -
    5/360"    -    jet2   -     -       -    jet1   -     -
    6/360"    -     -    jet3   -       -     -    jet1   -
    ....

Now let us assume, that the dot-diameter is different for each individual
jet, but the average among the jets matches the desired resolution. With
weaving adjacent rows are printed by different jets, thus the some averaging
takes place. Without weaving adjacent rows are printed by the same jet and
this makes the dot-diameter-deviations visible as 1/90"-stripes in the printout.

In Softweave-Mode (the default) the driver sends the data properly arranged to
the printer, while in Microweave-Mode the printer does the same job. But in
general the host-processor is much faster than the printers processor and
thus it is advantageous to let the host do this job. In addition to that, for
720DpI 8 Passes are required and the amount of buffer-space required to buffer
the data for the passes is far beyond the printers memory. SoftWeave requires
an odd value of "escp_Band", the Stylus Color provides 15 for that.

"OutputCode" controls the encoding used. In the basic modi, the choice consists
of "plain" and "runlength". The computation of runlength-encoded data does not
take much time, at least less than the datatranfer to the printer, thus this
is the recommended mode and of course the default. With the Stylus Color
Epson introduced some new encoding principles, namely "tiff" and "deltarow".
While the first was omitted from this driver, since there were not potential
advantages found, "deltarow" is available as an option. "Softweave" cannot
be used with this encoding, so if "OutputCode=deltarow" is set, Microweave
becomes the default. Maybe that the size of the ESC/P2-code becomes smaller,
but I have never observed increased printing-speed - things tend to become
slower with deltarow compared to Softweave.

Model
-----
Some ESC/P2-Printers, such as the Stylus 800, do not offer Microweave or
the commands required to do Softweave. Setting Model just changes the defaults
and ommits some parts of the initialization-sequence, which are not compatible
with the given printer model. Currently only "st800" is supported besides the
default (stcolor).


BEWARE: BUGS & PITFALLS
=======================

* The given ?coding and ?transfer arrays should be strictly monotonic.

* It is impossible to change WHITE: that's your paper.
  Thus R/G/B-transfer should end at 1.0 and C/M/Y/K-transfer should
  start at 0.0.

* Usually 8Bits per component yields fastest operation.

* The ColorAdjustMatrix is not used in the reverse-transformation, which
  is used, when Gostscript does the dithering (gs*-Modi). Expect funny
  results.

* If BitsPerPixel is less than 6, the entire coding/transfer-process
  does not work. This is always true for the gs*-modi and becomes true
  for the other modi, if BitsPerPixel is forced to low values.

* 720x720Dpi-Printing should never select the gs-modi and should always
  use stcolor.ps. (I prefer 360x720)

T E S T S (version 1.13 and above)
==================================

This section should give an overview over the performance in terms of
processing- & printing-time. Printing is done offline (via cp-instruction)
to measure real printing-speed, since at high-resolutions processing-time
is in the same order of magnitude and thus may become the limiting factor.

The various OutputCodes
-----------------------

I ran several files though ghostscript and recorded the size of the code,
the processing time and the printing-time, at least for some of the files.
Always the following options were used:

      "-sDEVICE=stcolor -sPAPERSIZE=a4 stcolor.ps - < file.ps"

(Actually "-sPAPERSIZE=a4" is in my gs_init.ps since I'm a germ.)

"Softweave" means actually, that nothing else was used, it is the default and
implies that odd v=40/h=10/m=15 mode (ESC . 1 40 10 15).

"Microweave" is just "-dMicroweave", which is equivalent to "ESC . 1 10 10 1",
with full skip-optimization and microweave-activated.

"deltarow" is the new encoding principle ("ESC . 3 10 10 1") with Microweave on.
It is activated with "-sOutputCode=deltarow".

Finally I wanted to see the plain Kathy Ireland and used "-sOutputCode=plain",
which is just replacing RLE by no encoding, thus "ESC . 0 40 10 15" is
used then.
[So sorry ;-)  Kathy was still blue dressed in front of the blue sea on a blue
air-cushion - nice to see but hard to dither]

So here are the results:

              golfer.ps    colorcir.ps      drawing.ps        brief.ps

deltarow   572751/48.180u 643374/41.690u  90142/46.180u/1:50 178563/49.350u/2:22

Microweave 590999/56.060u 754276/42.890u 338885/47.060u/1:50 282314/44.690u/2:22

               kathy.ps
deltarow   3975334/111.940u/5:35
Softweave  3897112/101.940u/3:10
Microweave 4062829/100.990u/3:15
plain/soft 5072255/104.390u/3:05

Evaluation:

A.) Might be, that I've not choosen the optimal deltarow-code, but even if
    it saves at lot of bytes, printing-speed is not increased.

B.) At least the printer prefers plain-kathy. In other words: Sending a
    1 Megabyte or 20% more data, has no impact on printing speed.
    [drawing.ps is an exception to this rule: plain prints slower than rle]

C.) But "unclever" coding -especially with deltarow- can significantly
    slows down printing. But even if very significant advantages in the
    size of the code ar achieved, "deltarow" is not competitive.
    [colorcir.ps shows savings in deltarow, but printing is a mess.]

### -- The BJC-600/BJC-4000/BJC-70/Stylewriter 2x00, BJC-800 printers -- ###

This section was written by Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr>.


HISTORY
-------

The BJC-600 driver was written in the first place by Yoshio Kuniyoshi
<yoshio@nak.math.keio.ac.jp> and later modified by me, Yves Arrouye
<Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr>. We both tried to make it evolve synchronously,
though Yoshio cannot be reached since a long time.

The drivers are based on code for the HP printers by George Cameron
<g.cameron@biomed.abdn.ac.ukis> (in fact, they are in the same file!),
so he's the first person to thank!

The 2.00 version of the drivers was a complete rewrite of the driver
(arguments, optimization, colour handling, in short: everything!) by
Yves Arrouye. The 2.x release is also the first one to be able to
use the full width of an A3 paper size...

With the 2.15 release, PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files for
the drivers are released. They are not complete at the moment but they
can be used to drive the printers' main features.

VERSION INFORMATION
-------------------

The BJC-600 driver is version 2.17.00 dated 5/23/96.
The BJC-800 driver is version 2.17.00 dated 5/23/96.


COMPILATION NOTES
-----------------

Configuration
-------------

* Default values for options and other stuff

Configuration for the drivers can be made by modifying defauts values
in the file gdevbjc.h or on the compilation line. If you don't do
that, the drivers use reasonable defaults that make them work "as
expected".
  All default values given below are defined in this file if you need
to change them to customize your installation (a bad idea, better use
options...).

* CMYK to RGB color conversion

By default, the drivers use the same algorithm as Ghostscript to
convert CMYK colors to RGB. If you prefer to use Adobe formulaes,
define USE_ADOBE_CMYK_RGB when compiling. (See the top of the
gdevcdj.c file to see the difference between the two.)

* Vertical centering of the printable area

The drivers center the imageable area horizontally, but not vertically
so that what can be printed does use the most of the output media. If
you define BJC_DEFAULT_CENTEREDAREA when compiling, then the top and
bottom margins will be the same, resulting in a (smaller) vertically
centered imageable area too.

* Margins

If you define USE_RECOMMENDED_MARGINS then the top and bottom margins
will be the same (i.e. BJC_DEFAULT_CENTEREDAREA will be defined for
you) and these margins will be those recommended by Canon, 12.4 mm.
  Because margins are a complicated thing (due to the fact that one
does rely on the mechanical precision of the printer), the drivers do
something about the bottom margin: by default the bottom margin is
9.54 mm for the bjc600 driver and 7 mm for the bjc800 one. If you
define USE_TIGHT_MARGINS then the bottom margin is 7 mm for both
drivers (but I never managed to get my own bjc600 print a line on this
low bound, hence the greater default). Regardless of the presence of
this define, USE_FIXED_MARGINS will not allow the bjc800 to use the
lower 7 mm bottom margin, so if you have a problem with the bottom
margin on a bjc800, just define that (without defining USE_TIGHT_MARGINS,
of course).

Compilation
-----------

Make sure the bjc600 and/or bjc800 devices are in your DEVICE_DEVS
variable. That is look in the makefile for your platform and add them
if necessary. This means for example adding them to the DEVICE_DEVS6
variable. The line should read something like that:

    DEVICE_DEVS6=bj10e.dev bj200.dev bjc600.dev bjc800.dev

Now if you get an error from make saying that it does not know how to
make bjc800.dev it's because you have an old makefile with only the
bjc600 device in it. You then have to copy the lines explaining how to
make bjc800.dev in your makefile. These lines are in devs.mak (under
the lines for making bjc600.dev) and should go just after the lines
for making bjc600.dev.

Testing the margins
-------------------

A quick way to be sure that the margins you selected (see above) are
okay is to print a file whose contents are:

      %!
      clippath stroke showpage

If the margins are okay, you will obtain a rectangle surrounding the
printable area.

USE OF THE DRIVERS
------------------

There are two drivers here: the "bjc600" one supports the BJC-600 and
BJC-4000 (maybe the BJC-70 as well) and the "bjc800" one supports the
BJC-800 series. When remarks here apply to both drivers, the name
"bjc" will be used.

Supported Options and Defaults
------------------------------

(Note: the names "options", "properties" and "parameters" will be used
to designate the same thing: device parameters that you can change.)

Preamble: if an option is given an incorrect value, an error will
occur. Unless stated otherwise, this error will be a rangecheckerror.
  Options may be set from the gs command-line (using the -d and -s
switches or other predetermined switches if they have an effect on the
driver) or using the setpagedevice Level 2 operator if Ghostscript has
been compiled with the level2 device (it should ;-)). There are *no*
special-purpose operators as one was able to find in Level 1 printers.

The default number of bits per pixel for the bjc is 24 (unless you
change the value of BJC_BITSPERPIXEL) and corresponds to a CMYK
printing. Supported modes are 1 bpp and 4 bpp (gray levels), 8 bpp, 16
bpp, 24 bpp and 32 bpp (colours). Colours are preferrably stored in
the CMYK model (which means that with 16 bpp there are only 16
different shades of each color, for example) but it is possible to
store them as RGB color for some depths.
  Some modes do Floyd-Steinberg dithering while some others don't and
use the default Ghostscript halftoning (in fact, when halftoning is used
dithering takes also place but due to the low point density it is
usually not efficient and thus invisible).

Here is a short description of each printing mode (expressed in
bpp/colors):

  32/4  CMYK Colour printing, Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
  24/4	Id. (But each primary colour is stored on 6 bits instead of 8.)

  24/3  RGB colour printing, Floyd-Steinberg dithering. This mode will
        *not* use the black cartridge (that's why it exists, for when you
        don't want to use it ;-)). Each primary colour is stored on 8
        bits as in the 32/4 mode, but black generation and under-color
        removal are done on the driver side and not by Ghostscript so you
        do not have any control on it. (This mode is not supported anymore
        on this driver.)

  16/4  CMYK colour printing, halftoned by Ghostscript. FS dithering
        is still visible here (but the halftone patterns are visible
        too!).

  8/4	Id. (But each primary colour is stored on 2 bits instead of 4.)

  8/3   RGB colour printing. This mode is not intended to be
        used. What I mean is that it should be used only if you 
	want to use custom halftone screens *and* the halftoning is
	broken using the 8/4 mode (some versions of gs have this
	problem).

  8/1	Gray-levels printing, Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

  1/1	Gray-levels printing, halftoned by GhostScript.

These modes are selected using the BitsPerPixel *and* Colors integers
options (either from the command line or in a PostScript program using
setpagedevice). See below.

A note about darkness of what is printed: Canon printers do print dark,
really. And the Floyd-Steinberg dithering may eventually darken your image
too. So you may need to apply gamma correction by calling gs as in

  % gs -sDEVICE=bjc600 gamma.ps myfile.ps

where gamma.ps changes the gamma correction (here to 3 for all colors):

  { 0.45 exp } dup dup currenttransfer setcolortransfer

(0.45 being value giving good results for me, your mileage may vary;
the bigger the value the lighter the output).

The drivers support printing at 90 dpi, 180 dpi and 360 dpi. Horizontal and
vertical resolutions must be the same or a limitcheck error will happen. A
rangecheck will happen too if the resolution is not 90 * 2**n. (If the
driver is compiled with -DBJC_STRICT a rangecheck will also happen if
the resolution is not one of those supported. This is not the case as we
expect that there may be a 720 dpi bjc someday).

Here are the various options supported by the bjc drivers, along with
their type, supported values, effect(s) and usage:

  BitsPerPixel (int)	Choose the depth of the page. Valid values are
			1, 8, 16, 24 and 32. Default is 24.
			  Note that when this is set for the first
			time, the Colors property is automatically
			adjusted unless it is also specified. Defaults
			adjustments are show in the table below,
			default choices are indicated by a star (*).
			  This table gives also the corresponding
			color models and the rendering method that is
			visible (GS means Ghostscript halftoning, FS
			Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and if both are
			present it means that the dithering of
			halftones is visible).

			    Valid Colors values for allowed
			         BitsPerPixel values.

			  Also note that automagical change of one
			parameter depending on the other one does not
			work in a setpagedevice call. This means that
			if you want to change BitsPerPixel to a value
			whose valid Colors values do not include the
			actual Colors value, you must change Colors
			too.

  Colors (int)		Choose the number of color components. Valid
			values are 1, 3 and 4. Default is 4.
			  This setting cannot be used in a PostScript
			program, only on Ghostscript's command-line.
			See ProcessColorModel below for what to use to
			change the number of colors with PostScript
			code.
			  Note that setting this property does limit
			the choices of BitsPerPixel. As for the
			previous property, its first setting may
			induce a setting of the "other value" (namely
			BitsPerPixel, here). Valid combinations are
			shown in the table below (XX indicates that
			the combination is valid, ** that this is the
			default).

				  Valid BitsPerPixel values
				  for allowed Colors values.

			  Also note that automagical change of one
			parameter depending on the other one does not
			work in a setpagedevice call. This means that
			if you want to change Colors to a value whose
			valid BitsPerPixel values do not include the
			actual BitsPerPixel value, you must change
			BitsPerPixel too.

  ProcessColorModel (symbol)
			A symbol taken from /DeviceGray, /DeviceRGB
			or /DeviceCMYK which can be used to select 1,
			3 or 4 colors respectively.
			  Note that this parameter takes precedence
			over the Colors one, and that both affect the
			same variable of the driver. (See Colors above
			for values combined with BitsPerPixel.)

  HWResolution (floats array)  
			An array of 2 floats giving the horizontal and
			vertical resolution in dots per inch. Supported
			values are 90, 180 and 360 and both values
			must be the same. Default is 360.
			  (On the gs command line, the resolution is
			changed by saying "-rXDPIxYDPI".)

  ManualFeed (bool)	Indicate that the sheets won't be fed automatically
			by the printer. Default is false.
			  (Not meaningful on the BJC-600, I fear.)

  MediaType (string)	Choose the media to print on. Values are chose
			amongst "PlainPaper", "CoatedPaper",
			"TransparencyFilm", "Envelope", "Card" and "Other".
			Default is "PlainPaper".
			  If the chose media is "Envelope", "Card" or
			"Other", the driver will make the printer go
			in thick mode automatically regardless of the
			media weight.

  MediaWeight (int or null)
			Choose the weight of the media (in g/m2). Using
			null indicates that the weight is of no
                        importance. Default is null.
			  If the specified media weight is greater
			than 105 (i.e. the value of the compilation 
                        default BJC???_MEDIAWEIGHT_THICKLIMIT) then
			the printer will be setup to use thick paper.

  PrintQuality (string) Choose the quality of printing. For the bjc600
			driver it can be one of "Normal", "High" and
			"Draft". For the bjc800 driver it can be one
			of "Low", "Normal", "High" and "Draft".
			Default is "Normal" for both drivers.
			  For both drivers, "High" means 200% black and
			100% cyan, magenta and yellow (on a bjc600 you
			will get the "Bk+" light).
			  For the bjc600 driver, "Normal" lits the
			"HQ" light while "Draft" unlits it.
			  For the bjc800 driver, "Low" has the effect
			of making only two printing passes instead of
			four (should be twice as fast ;-)). This is
			what is known as "CN" (Color Normal) mode.

  DitheringType (string)
			Choose a dithering algorithm. Actually the
			only valid values are "Floyd-Steinberg" and
			"None". "None" is the default for 1/1 print
			mode, "Floyd-Steinberg" for other modes.
			  At the moment this parameter is read-only,
			though no error will be generated if one tries
                        to change it.
			  This parameter is not of much value at the
			moment and is mainly here to reserve the name
			for future addition of dithering algorithms.

  PrintColors (int)	Mask for printing color. If 0, use black for
			any color.
			  Otherwise, the value must be the sum of any
		        of 1 (cyan), 2 (magenta), 4 (yellow) and 8
			(black), indicating which colors will be used
			for printing.
			  When printing colour, only those colour
			specified will be printed (this means that
			some planes will be missing).
			  When printing grays, black is used if it is
			present in the PrintColors; otherwise, the
			data is printed by superimposing each
			requested color.
			
  MonochromePrint (bool)
			*For bjc600 only*. Substitute black for Cyan,
			Magenta and Yellow when printing (useful for
			getting some monochrome output of a dithered
			printing for example). Default is false.
			  This is a hardware mechanism as opposed to
			the previous software one. I think that using
			this or setting PrintColors to 0 will give the
			same results.

Note that the MediaType and ThickMedia options will be replaced by the use
of the device InputAttributes and OutputAttributes as soon as possible.

Please note too that the print mode may be reset at the start of a print,
not at the end. This is the expected behaviour. If you need to reset
the printer to its default state, simply print a file that does just a
showpage.

Device Informations
-------------------

Here are other informations published by the driver that you will find
in the deviceinfo dictionary:

  OutputFaceUp (bool)   This has the boolean value true, indicating that
			the sheets are stacked face up.

  Version (float)	In the form M.mmpp where M is the major version,
			mm the bjc drivers minor version and pp the specific
			driver minor version (that is, M.mm will always be
			the same for the bjc600 and bjc800 drivers).

  VersionString (string)
			A string that gives the version info plus
			other indications. At the moment, things like
			'a' or 'b' may follow the version to indicate
			alpha or beta versions and the date of the
			last change to this version is given in the
			form MM/DD/YY (no,  it won't adapt to your
			locale!).

Hardware Margins
----------------

The BJC printers have top and bottom hardware margins of 3 mm and 7.1
mm respectively (Canon says 7 mm but this is not usable because of
the rounding of paper sizes to PostScript points).. The left margin is
3.4 mm for A4 and smaller paper sizes, 6.4 mm for US paper sizes,
envelopes and cards. It is 4.0 mm for A3 paper on the BJC-800.

The maximum printing width of a BJC-600 printer is 203 mm, in any event.
The maximum printing width of a BJC-800 printer is 289 mm on A3 paper,
and 203 mm on letter and A4 paper.


POSTSCRIPT PRINTER DESCRIPTION FILES
------------------------------------

The BJC600.PPD and BJC800.PPD files (whose long names are, respectively,
Canon_BubbleJetColor_600.ppd and Canon_BubbleJetColor_800.ppd) are PPD
files driving the features of the bjc600 and bjc800 drivers.

They can be used for example on NEXTSTEP systems (presumably on
OpenStep systems too) and on Unix systems with Adobe's TranScript and
pslpr (not tested).

The files are not complete at the moment. Please note too that
NEXTSTEP's printing interface does not correctly enforce constraints
specified in these files (in UIConstraints descriptions): you must
force yourself to use valid combinations of options.

Customization of the PPD files
------------------------------

By default the files say that the paper used is US Letter, and they
use a normalized transfer function.
  If you choose to use A4 printing by default, you must replace Letter by
A4 in lines that match the '\*Default.*: Letter' pattern.
  Some versions of Ghostscript have problems with normalized colors,
which makes them add magenta in gray levels. If you have this problem,
replace the '*DefaultTransfer: Normalized' line by the alternate (correct)
'*DefaultTransfer: Null' line.

Also note that the 'Thick Media' option is implemented by choosing a
value of 120 or 80 (for thick and thin media respectively) for the
MediaWeight feature of the drivers. If you ever change the threshold
for thick media in the driver code, you may need to change the values
in the PPD files too.

All customization should be done using the '*Include: ' feature of PPD
files so that your local changes will be kept if you get an update of
these PPD files.


OTHER INFORMATIONS

Reporting Problems
------------------

When you report a problem please be as descriptive as possible, and
please send information that can be used to reproduce the problem.
  Please don't forget to tell me which driver you use and its
version. Version information can be found in this file or preferrably
by issuing the following command in a shell:

    % echo "currentpagedevice /VersionString get ==" | \
        gs -q -sDEVICE=bjc600 -

(the % doesn't count as part of the command and the device name should
be the device you really use).

Contact Address

If you have problems with this driver (or if you are extremely
satisfied with it) you may email me at Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr.

Acknowledgements
----------------

I am particularly grateful to Yoshio Kuniyoshi <yoshio@nak.math.keio.ac.jp>
without whom I'd never make these drivers and also to Peter L. Deutsch
<ghost@aladdin.com> who answered *all* my (often silly) questions about
the drivers interface used by Ghostscript.
  Thanks also to the people who volunteered to beta-test the v2.x
BJC drivers; David Gaudine <david@donald.concordia.ca>, Robert M. Kenney
<rmk@unh.edu>, James McPherson <jmcphers@attila.stevens-tech.edu> and
Ian Thurlbeck <ian@stams.strath.ac.uk> (in an alphabetic listing) were
particularly helpful by discovering bugs and helping find out exact
paper margins on printers I don't have access to.
  And *many* thanks to Klaus-Gunther Hess <gunther@elmos.de> for
looking at the dithering code and devising a good CMYK dithering
algorithm for the Stylus Color, which I then adapted to the code of
these drivers.

### ---------------- MS-Windows DIB printer driver ----------------- ###

This section was written by Russell Lang, 4 September 1996

The mswinpr2 device uses MS-Windows printer drivers and should work
with any printer with DIB raster capabilities.
The printer resolution cannot be selected using PostScript commands 
from Ghostscript; use the printer setup in the Control Panel instead.

If no Windows printer name is specified in -sOutputFile, Ghostscript
will prompt for a Windows printer using the standard Print Setup
dialog box.  You must set the orientation to Portrait, and you must
set the page size to that expected by Ghostscript.  Failure to do so 
will result in the image being clipped. Ghostscript sets the physical 
device size to that of the Windows printer driver, but it does not 
update the PostScript clipping path.

If a Windows printer name is specified in -sOutputFile, using 
the format "\\spool\printer_name", e.g.
  -sOutputFile="\\spool\Apple LaserWriter II NT"
then Ghostscript will attempt to open the Windows printer without
any prompts (except of course if the printer is connected to FILE:).
Ghostscript attempts to set the Windows printer page size and orientation
to match that expected by Ghostscript, but doesn't always succeed.
The following algorithm is used:
- If the requested page size matches one of the Windows standard
  page sizes +/- 2mm, ask for that standard size.
- Otherwise if the requested page size matches one of the Windows 
  standard page sizes in landscape mode, ask for that standard size
  in landscape.
- Otherwise ask for the page size by specifying its dimensions only.
- If using Windows NT, select a form that matches the page size.
  (This isn't working at the moment)
- Merge the above requests with the defaults.
  If the printer driver ignores the requested paper size, no
  error will be generated.  It will print on the wrong paper size.
- Open the Windows printer with the merged orientation and size.
The Ghostscript physical device size will be updated to match
the Windows printer physical device.
