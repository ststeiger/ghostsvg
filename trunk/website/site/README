These are mod_vigule template files defining the dynamic pages on the
ghostscript.com site. A request for index.html will cause the virgule
engine to process the index.xml template, expanding and filtering as
indicated.

If there is no corresponding xml file, it will look for a static html
file in a seperate directory, or failing that return control to apache
so it can try other methods to map the url.
