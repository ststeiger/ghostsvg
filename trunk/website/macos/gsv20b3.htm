		<h2>Obtaining MacGSView</h2>
		<p>You can download the installer and the source package for MacGSView:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/aladdin/gs600/mac/test/MacGSView_2.0b3_Installer.bin">MacGSView 2.0b3 Installer</a> (3.5 MB)
			<li><a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/aladdin/gs600/mac/test/MacGSView_2.0b3_Source.sit.bin">MacGSView 2.0b3 Sources for CodeWarrior</a> (222 kB)
		</ul>
		<p>The Ghostscript 6.01 software is included in the installer, so you don't have to download any additional files.</p>
		<p>For interested developers:<br>
		The latest MacGSView sources can also be obtained via anonymous CVS. If you are using a unix shell the command to check out the entire module is:<br>
		<i>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ghostscript.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ghostscript checkout macgsview</i></p>
		<h2>System Requirements</h2>
		<p>MacGSView works on any Apple Power Macintosh, PowerBook (with PowerPC), iMac, iBook with MacOS 8.5 or later installed.<br>
		How much memory you really do need depends on the documents you want to open, and at which resolution you wan to view them. If you have 5MB free for MacGSView to use, you should be able to view most standard size documents.</p>
		<h2>Features and changes from MacGS 5.50</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Ghostscript is no longer part of the application but is loaded dynamically from a shared library (GhostScriptLib PPC)
			<li>MacGSView handles documents conforming to the Adobe Document Structure Convention: you can view or print pages randomly
			<li>Free zoom in/out of pages
			<li>Rendering at different color depths and resolutions
			<li>Copy pages as PICT to the clipboard
			<li>Save PS/PDF documents as PICT, TIFF, JPEG, BMP, PDF, PNG, and many more
			<li>Render and view multiple documents at the same time
			<li>VERY basic AppleScript support (open, close, quit)
		</ul>
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Some PDF documents don't render correctly
			<li>Rotated pages are not always handled correctly.
			<li>MacGSView is incompatible with <i>Action Files</i><br>
			Solution: add MacGSView to the list of incompatible applications
			<li>On some machines, rendering takes much more time than really needed. A normal text page should render in about 1 second on a G3. On such systems it helps to move the mouse or click around to speed rendering up
			<li>Printing seems to be a major problem. The LaserWriter driver and many other drivers do not work at all. This will be solved in a future version.
		</ul>
		<h2>Version History</h2>
