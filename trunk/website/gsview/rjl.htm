he receives.
<p>
You may send mail with the following to Russell Lang:
<ul>
<li> Corrections to the WWW pages.

  have first made sure that you have read the GSview documentation, 
  and also made sure that the bug is not in your computer only.

<li> requesting help in compiling Ghostscript.
  See <a href="../doc/cvs/Make.htm">How to build Ghostscript from

  message.
  Read the <a href="gsviewen.htm#Common_Problems">GSview help</a>
