<P>
The two most common problems with GSview 1.4 and earlier are
<DL>
<DT> <B>Can't run gswin</B> or <B>Can't run gsos2</B>
<DD>
 GSview requires a suitable version of Ghostscript (gsos2.exe for OS/2,
 gswin.exe or gswin32.exe for MS-Windows).
 This error message occurs if you don't have Ghostscript,
 or if GSview can't find Ghostscript.

 From the GSview menu select <B>Options</B> | <B>Ghostscript Command</B>
 and enter the correct executable path and include path for Ghostscript.
 For example: <BR>
  <PRE>c:\gs\gswin.exe -Ic:\gs;c:\gs\fonts;c:\psfonts</PRE>

 You must set the include path for Ghostscript using either the
 <B>-I</B> command or the <B>GS_LIB</B> environment variable.
<P>
<DT> <B>Ghostscript starts and then immediately exits with error code 1</B>
<DD>
 First read the error message in the Ghostscript window.

 Ghostscript probably couldn't find its initialisation files.
 Set the Ghostscript include path by adding <B>-Idirectory</B> to the
 command in <B>Options</B> | <B>Ghostscript Command</B>, where <B>directory</B>
 includes the name of the directory that contains the Ghostscript
 initialisation files,
</DL>

Other common problems are described in the GSview on-line help.
This is available for <A HREF="os2help.html"> OS/2</A> and 
<A HREF="winhelp.html"> MS-Windows</A>.
