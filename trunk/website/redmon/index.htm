  RedMon - Redirection Port Monitor</H1><P>
Transparent PostScript printing from Windows 95/98 and NT.
<HR>
<H1>Overview</H1>
<P>The <B>RedMon</B> port monitor redirects a special printer port 
to a program. 
<B>RedMon</B> is commonly used with Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer to emulate a PostScript printer. 
<P><B>RedMon</B> can be used with any program that accepts data on 
standard input. 
<P>Using <B>RedMon</B> you create a redirected printer port.  
If you connect a Windows printer driver to the redirected printer port, 
all data sent to the redirected port will be forwarded by <B>RedMon</B> 
to the standard input of a program.  
The output of this program can be sent to different printer port, 
or the program can generate whatever output it desires.
<P>A PostScript Windows printer redirected to a RedMon port can shared  
on a network. 
When this printer is configured to use Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer, it appears as a PostScript printer to other network clients. 
<P>RedMon can also be used with an lpr client to provide transparent
access to printers on Unix hosts.  This is useful under Windows 95/98.
Windows NT already has an lpr port monitor so there is no point in
using RedMon for this.  Another alternative is to use RedMon with 
<A HREF="http://www.concentric.net/~ravitz/">PrintGLN</A>, an HPGL
pen plotter emulator.
<P>
The <A HREF="en/redmon.htm">RedMon online help</A> is available
in <A HREF="en/redmon.htm">English</A>,
<A HREF="fr/redmon.htm">French</A>,
<A HREF="de/redmon.htm">German</A>,
and <A HREF="se/redmon.htm">Swedish</A>.
<P>If you use the Ghostscript mswinpr2 device with RedMon under 
Windows NT, please read these <A HREF="muir.htm">notes</A>.
<P>
<H1>Availability</H1>
RedMon works under Windows 95/98, Windows NT 4.0 and NT 3.51.
It should work under Windows 2000, but it has only had limited testing.
<P>
RedMon version 1.5 can be downloaded from
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/redmon15.zip">
ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/redmon15.zip</A>.
Older versions for 
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/redmon13de.zip"> German</A>,
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/redmon13fr.zip"> French</A>,
and
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/redmon13se.zip"> Swedish</A>
are also available.
Source code is included.
The RedMon licence requires that you include the source if
you redistribute RedMon.
<P>
The French versions is missing two bitmaps in the
help file about Windows NT 4.0.  If you have a French 
version of Windows NT 4.0 and are willing to capture these bitmaps, 
please contact 
<A HREF="../gsview/rjl.htm">Russell Lang</A>
about grabbing a couple of screen bitmaps for the help file.
<P>
All user text is stored in language specific resources.
Translating RedMon to another language should be straightforward.
Contact the author if you want to translate RedMon into
your language.
<P>
If using RedMon with Aladdin Ghostscript 5.10, you will need to
replace <TT>gswin32c.exe</TT> with the patched version at 
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/aladdin/gs510/gswin32c.exe">
ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/aladdin/gs510/gswin32c.exe</A>.
This patched version puts standard input into binary mode and
fixes a problem with spaces in the Ghostscript path, as documented in 
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/aladdin/gs510/gswin32c.txt">
gswin32c.txt</A>.  This is fixed in Aladdin Ghostscript 5.50.

<H1>Beta version</H1>
<p>
Beta test version 1.6 is available from
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/beta/redmon16b.zip">
ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/beta/redmon16b.zip</A>.
</p>
<p>
Most of the changes are internal - there has been a major 
reorganisation of the code to allow parts of RedMon to be 
reused in other port monitors.
Changes that should be visible are the addition of the
environment variables REDMON_SESSIONID (for Windows Terminal
Server) and REDMON_FILENAME.  When replacing %d with the
name of the document, RedMon now removes characters that
are invalid for use in a filename.
Attempting to print to a RedMon port from a printer 
with bi-directional support enabled will now always fail.
</p>
<p>
The beta version will expire on 31 December 2001.
</p>
