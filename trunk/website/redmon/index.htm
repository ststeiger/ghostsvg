  RedMon - Redirection Port Monitor</H1><P>
Transparent PostScript printing from Windows 95/98 and NT.
<HR>
<H1>Overview</H1>
<P>The <B>RedMon</B> port monitor redirects a special printer port 
to a program. 
<B>RedMon</B> is commonly used with Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer to emulate a PostScript printer. 
<P><B>RedMon</B> can be used with any program that accepts data on 
standard input. 
<P>Using <B>RedMon</B> you create a redirected printer port.  
If you connect a Windows printer driver to the redirected printer port, 
all data sent to the redirected port will be forwarded by <B>RedMon</B> 
to the standard input of a program.  
The output of this program can be sent to different printer port, 
or the program can generate whatever output it desires.
<P>A PostScript Windows printer redirected to a RedMon port can shared  
on a network. 
When this printer is configured to use Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer, it appears as a PostScript printer to other network clients. 
<P>RedMon can also be used with an lpr client to provide transparent
access to printers on Unix hosts.  This is useful under Windows 95/98.
Windows NT already has an lpr port monitor so there is no point in
using RedMon for this.  Another alternative is to use RedMon with 
<A HREF="http://www.concentric.net/~ravitz/">PrintGLN</A>, an HPGL
pen plotter emulator.

<P>If you use the Ghostscript mswinpr2 device with RedMon under 
Windows NT, please read these <A HREF="muir.htm">notes</A>.

<H1>Beta version</H1>
<p>
Beta test version 1.6 is available from
<A HREF="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/beta/redmon16b.zip">
ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/beta/redmon16b.zip</A>.
</p>
<p>
Most of the changes are internal - there has been a major 
reorganisation of the code to allow parts of RedMon to be 
reused in other port monitors.
Changes that should be visible are the addition of the
environment variables REDMON_SESSIONID (for Windows Terminal
Server) and REDMON_FILENAME.  When replacing %d with the
name of the document, RedMon now removes characters that
are invalid for use in a filename.
Attempting to print to a RedMon port from a printer 
with bi-directional support enabled will now always fail.
</p>
<p>
The beta version will expire on 31 December 2001.
