<H1>Redirection Port Monitor</H1>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="1">Overview</A></H1>
The <B>RedMon</B> port monitor redirects a special printer port 
to a program. 
<B>RedMon</B> is commonly used with Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer to emulate a PostScript printer. 
<P><B>RedMon</B> can be used with any program that accepts data on 
standard input. 
<P>Using <B>RedMon</B> you create redirected printer ports.  If you connect a 
Windows printer driver to the redirected printer port, all data sent 
to the redirected port will be forwarded by <B>RedMon</B> to the 
standard input of a program.  This program is then responsible 
for processing the data and producing new output. 
<P>A PostScript Windows printer redirected to a RedMon port can shared 
on a network. 
When this printer is configured to use Ghostscript and a non-PostScript 
printer, it appears as a PostScript printer to other network clients. 
<P>PostScript written to a RedMon port can be converted to a 
PDF file using Ghostscript. 
<P>RedMon supports Windows 95/98, Windows 2000, NT 4.0 and 3.51. 
<P>Configuring <B>RedMon</B> is not a job for novices.

<H1><A NAME="28">Installation</A></H1>
Run <B>setup.exe</B> to install the <B>RedMon</B> redirection port monitor. 
The files <B>setup.exe</B>, <B>redmon95.dll</B>, <B>redmonnt.dll</B>, <B>redmon35.dll</B>, 
<B>redmon.hlp</B> and <B>unredmon.exe</B> 
must all be in the same directory. 
<P>Installing <B>RedMon</B> under Windows NT will require Administrator 
privileges.  When using Windows Terminal Server, you must install 
and configure RedMon on the server console. 
<P>Follow the <A HREF="#274">Ghostscript Example</A> for the rest of the configuration. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="40">Uninstallation</A></H1>
To uninstall, you must first disconnect all printer drivers from 
the <B>Redirected</B> ports and then delete the <B>Redirected</B> ports. 
Use <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> from the <B>Control Panel</B> to remove 
<B>RedMon - Redirection Port Monitor</B>. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="46">Add Port</A></H1>
In the <B>Add Redirected Port</B> dialog box, enter the name 
of a port to be serviced by <B>RedMon</B>. 
By default, the first port you define will be named <B>RPT1:</B>. 
<P><B>Windows 95/98</B> After adding a port, you need to configure it 
with <A HREF="#64">Port Settings</A> and <B>Spool Settings</B>. 
Any printer driver connected to this port <B>must have</B> the 
<B>Spool Settings</B> set to 
<B>Disable bi-directional support for this printer</B>. 
<P><B>Windows NT</B> After adding a port, you need to configure it 
with <A HREF="#64">Configure Port</A>.   <B>Enable bidirectional support</B> 
should be disabled. 
<P>You cannot use the same port name as an existing port. 
In particular, you cannot create a redirected port named LPT1: 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="64">Port Settings</A></H1>
In the <B>Port Settings</B> dialog box, specify a redirection program 
which is to receive on standard input all data sent to this port. 
The program name is entered in the first edit field 
and the arguments in the second edit field. 
<P>The <B>Output</B> from the program can be set to one of 
<A HREF="#92">Program handles output</A>, <A HREF="#99">Prompt for filename</A>, 
<A HREF="#120">Copy stdout to printer</A>, <A HREF="#128">Copy temporary file to printer</A> 
or <A HREF="#143">Copy pipe to printer</A>. 
If one of the latter three, you need to select a <B>Printer</B>. 
<P>If you select <A HREF="#156">Print Errors</A>, an error report page will 
be printed. 
<P>The program can be run <B>Normal</B>, <B>Minimized</B> or <B>Hidden</B>. 
<P><A HREF="#196">Run as User</A> is available only under Windows NT and is 
usually disabled.

<H2><A NAME="92">Program handles output</A></H2>
When output is set to<B> Program handles output</B>, the redirection 
program is entirely responsible for all output. 
If the redirection program wants to write to another printer, 
it must do this itself.  If the redirection program wishes 
to generate no output at all, this is also acceptable. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="99">Prompt for filename</A></H2>
When output is set to<B> Prompt for filename</B>, the 
redirection program should write its output to a file. 
The name of the file is obtained from a <B>Save as</B> dialog, 
can be obtained by inserting <B>%1</B> in the program arguments. 
If you wish to place <B>%1</B> in the program arguments and do 
not want it substituted with the filename, you 
must instead use <B>%%1</B>. 
<P>For example, the program arguments might include: 
<PRE>
 -sOutputFile="%1"
</PRE>
<P>This method is recommended for use with Ghostscript, 
and is commonly used with a PostScript printer driver 
and the Ghostscript pdfwrite device to create a <A HREF="#469">PDF writer</A>. 
<P>Do not share a printer which uses RedMon with<B> Prompt for filename</B>. 
RedMon will not allow this because the <B>Save as</B> dialog box would 
appear on the server computer, not the client which submitted the 
print job. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="120">Copy stdout to printer</A></H2>
When output is set to<B> Copy stdout to printer</B>, the redirection 
program should write its output to standard output. 
RedMon will copy this to the specified printer. 
Standard output will not be written to the log file. 
<P>This method should not be used with Ghostscript 5.50 or earlier. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="128">Copy temporary file to printer</A></H2>
When output is set to<B> Copy temporary file to printer</B>, the 
redirection program should write its output to a temporary file. 
RedMon will copy this temporary file to the specified printer. 
The name of the temporary file is specifed by RedMon, and 
can be obtained by inserting <B>%1</B> in the program arguments. 
If you wish to place <B>%1</B> in the program arguments and do 
not want it substituted with the temporary filename, you 
must instead use <B>%%1</B>. 
<P>For example, the program arguments might include: 
<PRE>
 -sOutputFile="%1"
</PRE>
<P>This method is recommended for use with any version of Ghostscript. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="143">Copy pipe to printer</A></H2>
When output is set to<B> Copy pipe to printer</B>, the redirection 
program should write its output to a pipe created by RedMon. 
The handle as a hexadecimal value can be obtained by 
inserting <B>%h</B> in the program arguments. 
RedMon will copy this pipe to the specified printer. 
<P>For example, the program arguments might include: 
<PRE>
 -sOutputFile="%%handle%%%h"
</PRE>
<P>This method is recommended for use with Ghostscript 
and requires Ghostscript 6.0 or later. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="156">Print Errors</A></H2>
If <B>Print Errors</B> is selected and the redirection program 
terminates prematurely, RedMon will print an error report 
page.  This will contain the contents of the <A HREF="#228">Log File</A>. 
Selecting <B>Print Errors</B> and <B>Debug</B> will result in much 
wasted paper. 
<P><B>Print Errors</B> is most useful when a redirection program 
writes an error message to standard output, which is captured 
by the log file. 
<P><B>Print Errors</B> is ignored if <A HREF="#92">Program handles output</A> is 
selected. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="170">Environment Variables</A></H2>
The redirection program can obtain some print job parameters 
from the environment variables.  Those set by RedMon are: 
<P><B>REDMON_PORT</B> is the port name, typically "RPT1:". 
<P><B>REDMON_JOB</B> is the job number, an integer. 
<P><B>REDMON_PRINTER</B> is the name of the printer (e.g. "HP DeskJet 500"). 
<P><B>REDMON_MACHINE</B> is the name of the machine that created the job 
(e.g. "\\Desktop"). 
<P><B>REDMON_USER</B> is the name of the user who owns the job 
(e.g. "JCITIZEN"). 
<P><B>REDMON_DOCNAME</B> is the name of the print job 
(e.g. "Printer Test Page"). 
<P><B>TEMP</B> and <B>TMP</B> are directories for temporary files. 
<P>Note that under Windows NT, the redirection program runs 
in the environment of the SYSTEM account.  Apart from the 
above environment variables, very few are set.  The registry 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER and user profile are that of "Default User". 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="196">Run as User</A></H2>
"Run as User" causes the program to be run as the local user 
who submitted the print job. 
<P>"Run as User" is only available for NT 4 or later  Do not enable 
this if the printer is shared on a network. 
Remote users can't run programs on your computer. 
If a remote user tries to submit a job, the EXE will fail 
with a message like 
<PRE>
 Initialization of dynamic link library
 C:\WINNT4\system32\kernel32.dll failed.
 The process is terminating abnormally.
</PRE>
<P>The spooler service will then be locked up until you 
stop and restart it. 
<P><B>Run as User </B>is intended for launching a GUI program 
such as GSview locally via RedRun. 
<P>While the program will have the security attributes of 
the user who submitted the print job, it will have the 
environment of the SYSTEM account.  User profile information 
will not be correct. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="219">Shut down delay</A></H2>
After writing all data to the redirection program, <B>RedMon</B> will 
normally wait up to 300 seconds for the redirection program to 
close before writing any output to the printer and closing the log file. 
If the program takes longer than 300 seconds to terminate, the output 
of the program may be lost or truncated. 
Some standard output may not get written to the log file. 
If this occurs, you may need to increase the <B>Shut down delay</B>. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="228">Log File Properties</A></H1>
If you tell <B>RedMon</B> to use a log file, all standard output from 
the redirection program will be written to this file. 
This is useful for capturing error messages from the program to 
which you have redirected standard input. 
<P>To use a log file, you must check <B>Use Log File</B> and then 
specify a valid file name for the log file. 
<P>If you check <B>Debug</B>, RedMon will write extra debugging messages 
to the log file.  These messages are probably only useful to the 
author of RedMon. 
If you want the log file to contain only the standard output 
of the redirected program, uncheck <B>Debug</B>. 
<P>See the <A HREF="#274">Ghostscript Example</A>.

<H1><A NAME="246">What is Ghostscript?</A></H1>
Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: 
<P>- An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language and the Adobe 
Portable Document Format (PDF -- sometimes confused with Acrobat, 
Adobe's PDF browser/editor product), and 
<P>- A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement 
the graphics and filtering (data compression / decompression / conversion) 
capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript language 
and in PDF.

 REDMON ReadPort: You must disable bi-directional printer support
 for this printer.

<P><B>Problem:</B> Attempting to configure a port gives the error message: 
"This option is not available or not allowed". 
<P>You may need to configure the RedMon port from the computer 
running RedMon, rather than a remote computer. 
<P><B>Problem:</B> Windows NT lpd treats data as text instead of raw. 
<P>This isn't a problem with RedMon, but you might just need this 
information.  When printing from Unix to NT, two common methods 
are to use Samba to write to a RedMon port, or to use lpr to write to 
the lpd service on NT.  The lpd service is not installed by default. 
<P>Windows NT lpd sometimes decides to treat the incoming stream as text 
rather than raw, causing the PostScript code to be printed instead 
of being interpreted.  This can be fixed with an appropriate command 
option for lpr at the remote Unix box, or at the Windows NT end with 
regedit, see:
