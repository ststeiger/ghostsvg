The only web page that should be in this directory is index.htm.
Files that were in http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ are now
in the doc subdirectory.
This allows http://www.ghostscript.com/ and http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
to have identical copies, each updated from the CVS master copy.

Pages should use the style sheet gsweb.css, except for
doc/AFPL/N.NN/* which use their own gs.css.

Where possible, please use short 8.3 filenames so that these 
pages can also be accessed when written on an ISO9660 CD.
