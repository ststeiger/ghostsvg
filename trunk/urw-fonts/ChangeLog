2002-06-29  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

    The hints on Nimbus Sans Regular have been modified in the
    following ways:
     - Removed odd vertical stem hints (width of horizontal
       stems) from f, F, t, E, yen sign, fi ligature, 
       fl ligature, AE ligature, R, Lstroke, OE ligature,
       lstroke, E" variants, t, variants, Eth, Dstoke, etc.
     - Fixed hints on 1 to be two ghost hints instead of one
       hint the height of the font
     - fix bottom stem of u to have integer coordinates
     - fixed hints on |
     - fixed hints on inverted exclamation mark

    The hints on Nimbus Mono L Oblique have been modified in the
    following ways:

     - Removed vertical stem hints from horizontal serifs on
       roman characters.

2002-06-25  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

    The hints on Nimbus Sans Regular have been modified in the
    following ways:

     - Added ghost hint to the top of 4 to keep it from being
       taller than the other digits.
     - Reduced the width of the left stem hint for H to 83
       (probably no real differences)
     - Changed the StemSnapV values from [78 85 94] to [78 83 92]
       (and fixed up StdVW accordingly)
       This corresponds to the values in the font (which are 83/93
       for lower case and upper case stems) better and makes
       the width-88 stems on M and N snap to to upper case 
       widths not lower-case widths.
