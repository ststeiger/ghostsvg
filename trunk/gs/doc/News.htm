	re-create the table of contents here, because it will replace the

	TOC to see how to edit it for visual conciseness.

<h2><a name="Version9.00"></a>Version 9.00 (2010-08-24)</h3>

<p>This is the first release in the stable 9.x series.

<p>This release includes a move to an ICC-based color rendering workflow. The
design allows easy integration of 3rd party color management modules (CMMs)
and management of DeviceN and spot source colors with ICC profiles as well
as with non-ICC proprietary methods. The default CMM is the well known littleCMS.
Postscript color objects and non-ICC CIE-based PDF color spaces are converted to
equivalent ICC profiles enabling complete color management for all color spaces by
an ICC-based CMM. New command line options enable the specification of gray, rgb
and cmyk default ICC profiles as well as output device ICC profiles. The new
work flow provides performance improvements in the rendering of images, shadings
and transparencies. In addition, the color conversions are designed to work
efficiently in multithreaded display list (c-list) rendering through the use of a
shared link cache. Finally, proper ICC based rendering now occurs for ALL XPS
objects including Named colors, N-Channel colors and images with internally embedded
ICC profiles.
 
<p>The second major change in this release is that glyph rendering for all font types
except Type 3 is now handled by Freetype (via a much improved and enhanced Font API).
The most obvious benefit of this is a complete, and proven implementation of the 
TrueType byte code interpreter (now unencumbered by patents).

<p> Another major change is that the Postscript interpreter's graphics state now
stores two separate colour space settings for stroking and filling, to better
support the stroke and fill colours required by the PDF interpreter.

<p>Finally, support for optional content has bee added to the PDF interpreter.

<p> This release also includes a number of improvements to the pdfwrite device
to improve reliability and quality with PCL and XPS input. Many improvements to
the support of JPX images in PDF files, PDF annotation rendering and the usual
number of general bug and robustness fixes.
