	WARNING: do not use Pete Kaiser's emacs function "gs-toc" alone to
	re-create the table of contents here, because it will replace the
	hand-edited TOC subheads with a separate subhead for each H2 in
	the body of the file.  Or if you do, first look at the original
	TOC to see how to edit it for visual conciseness.

<h1><a name="Version6.22"></a>Version 6.22 (2000-xx-xx)</h1>

<p>
This fileset consists mostly of bug fixes.  It also further improves the PDF
writer, which now handles ImageType 3 images and PatternType 2 (shading)
patterns.

<p>
All problems registered on SourceForge numbered 108819 or lower are closed,
except for the following: 101549, 101814, 101905, 101955, 102146, 102735,
104118, 105289, 105558, 106340, 106652, 108639.

<p>
The following projects are in a partially completed state in the PDF writer:

<ul>

<li>CID-keyed fonts (gdevpdf[eftw].c) -- barely started.

</ul>

<h2><a name="6.22_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Procedures)
	- Versions now have odd numbers during development, even numbers
when released.
	- The TMPDIR environment variable, if set, now takes precedence
over TEMP.
	- On MS-DOS, MS Windows, and OS/2 platforms, the batch files that
invoke Ghostscript now use a default name of gswin32 or gswin32c rather than
simply gs.
(Drivers)
	- The PCL drivers now select a given paper size if the requested
height is at least 0.1" greater than the height of the next smaller paper
size, rather than if the requested height is at least as large as that of
the given paper size.
(Interpreter)
	- user_names_p and system_names_p may now be NULL: clients must
check this.
	- scan_comment_proc and scan_dsc_proc are now deprecated, and will
disappear in the near future.
	- The values in psuserparams are now checking procedures rather
than parameter values.
	- Comments beginning with %! are treated as "DSC comments", like
comments beginning with %%.
(Library)
	- The macro for declaring the fill_rectangle procedure of a shading
is now upper-case.  The fill_rectangle procedure is now a member of a procs
structure; there is a new macro for calling it.
	- The parameter list and return value for gs_currentgray have
changed.  This is very unfortunate, but it was unavoidable.
