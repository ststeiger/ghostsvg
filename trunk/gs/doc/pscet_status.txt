09-24-2  DIFF	In "Technical Paths", Ghostscript is missing some line segments
		generated from 'strokepath' on a wide line with some cap/join
		settings. assigned: Ray (actually Nori is looking into this)
		-
		Note the path generated with 'strokepath' is implementation dependent.
		Here is what PLRM says :
					[beg quote]
		The path produced by strokepath is suitable for use as the implicit operand to a
		subsequent fill, clip, or pathbbox operation. In general, it is not suitable for
		stroke, as it may contain interior segments or disconnected subpaths produced by
		strokepath's conversion from stroke to outline.
					[end quote]
		What we observe with Adobe CPSI and Tek hardcopy is "disconnected subpaths".
		If the implementation of a fix for this proves too messy, we may have to
		classify the 28 DIFF files as 'aok'.

		cpsi/09-34-15  missing

09-34-16  AOK	GS missing some graphics seen on Tek hardcopy. 
		Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color - RJJ.
		I do not understand Ray's comment.  Using the ppmraw device, I
		see all of the graphics at the right side of the page.  Please
		note that the appearance of this page depends upon the process
		color model of the output device.  The page uses spot colors.
		Thus the appearance of the page depends upon how the device
		treats spot colors.  One of the spot color is called C1 and it
		is white.  The C1 spot color is printed on top of the lower four
		graphics.  Thus if the output device supports spot colors then
		this results in a white appearance for this section of the page.
		The GS tiffsep device (which supports spot colors) shows this
		section of the page as being white.  The tiffsep device also
		produces a separation for the C1 spot color which shows the area
		covered by this ink.  Devices which do not support spot colors
		use the tint transform function to convert the spot colors into
		process colors.  Logically the tint tranform functions should
		produced the same appearance as the spot colors.  However this is
		not the case with this page.  Thus devices which do not support
		spot colors such as the ppmraw (process color model = DeviceRGB)
		or the tiff32nc (device process color = DeviceCMYK only) use the
		tint transform functions are producing different appearances.
		The same effect can be seen with Distiller/Acrobat 7.0.  The
		presence of the spot colors can be examined with the 'Output
		Preview' feature.  Disabling the 'Overprint Preview' changes
		the process color model of Acrobat to DeviceRGB.  This forces
		the use of the tint transform functions by Acrobat.  The
		'missing' graphics then appear.

09-34-2  DIFF	GS has Yellow graphic, Tek shows Red for 'SeparateUnBlue setcolorspace'
		(right of "1.0" text). Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color  assign: Dan
		NOTE: AD7 and Tek hardcopy output differ in same areas. - RJJ
		Distiller/Acrobat 7.0 differ on four graphics.  These are the five below
		the text that says "( /HIVAL 4095 def )".  Distiller/Acrobat shows the
		first four of these as a grayish shade.  The fifth is a paler shade of
		gray.  GS shows these as black, gray, burgandy, brown, and red respectively.
		- ADC. 
		cps/09-34-2  missing  Assign Dan

09-34-3  DIFF	GS has missing graphic, Tek shows Cyan for 'SeparateUncyan setcolorspace'
		(right of "1.0" text). Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color  assign: Dan
		NOTE: AD7 and Tek hardcopy output differ in same areas.a - RJJ
		There are two things happening with this page.  The 'SeparateUncyan'
		issue is another example of a separation color space which has a
		tint transform function which does not produce logically consistent
		results.  Thus the output depends upon whether or not the tint transform
		function is used.  This can be seen by disabling the 'Overprint Preview'
		feature in Acrobat 7.0.  GS produces results which are consistent with
		Acrobat for both cases. (this is expaected).
		The second issue (which is a problem) is a difference in the appearance
		of the color spaces below the text that says "( /HIVAL 4095 def )" 
		(Apparently a similar problem as the one seen in 09-34-02). - ADC

09-34-6  AOK 	GS matches graphics colors, but the code equivalent to
		/Pattern setcolorspace 16 16 true matrix { (jihad) } imagemask
                leaves imagemask operands on the stack on Adobe interpreters.
                This is an obvious bug that we don't want in Ghostscript.
		cpsi/09-34-6  missing

09-34-7  DIFF	GS has different 'currentcolor' results and different color graphics
		Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color  assign: Dan
		NOTE: AD7 and Tek hardcopy output differ in same areas. - RJJ
		Thre are two issues with this page.  The first issue is the colors of
		of the various graphics on the page.   The page has spot colors.  It
		also has tint transform functions which do not provide logically
		consistent results.  Thus the appearance of the graphics depend upon
		if the tint transform functions are being used.  The results with GS
		match the results from Acrobat 7.0 as expected.
		The second issue (which is a problem) is that the currentcolor value
		for the CIEBasedDEFG differs.  The graphic for the same line is also
		missing (which is probably related.) - ADC

09-36-4  DIFF	Dash pattern differences with GS.
		Analyzed by Igor. 
                -
                GS rounds coordinates to 1/256th of a pixel.
		Due to that, when a curve is converted into a polygon,
		its vertices are rounded, and therefore the length
		of the polygon becomes few bigger than the ideal polygon.
		Then applying the dash, it covers a smaller part
		of the polygon than with CPSI.
		-
		One possible solution is :
		Add floating coordinates to path segments.
		The floating coordinates duplicate fixed ones,
		and used only for computing the segment length.
		The old fixed coordinated are used for anything else
		as they do now.
		-
		Passing to Raph who should make the decision whether to do this change.
		assign: Raph.

09-36-5  DIFF	In "Technical Paths", Ghostscript differs a lot, combination
		of 09-24-2 linecap linejoin issues and dash issues. Defer 
		this until after 09-24-2 is addressed.  Assign: Ray

09-36-6  OK	Fixed by r7123.

09-36-7  DIFF	LOOK 14 has minor differences.  Assign: Ray

09-37-1  AOK	GS similar to Tek, but the value at which polygon edges changes from
		16 to 8 differs (GS at 53, Tek at 19). Also Tek changes from 'smooth'
		to 16 at 5, GS at 13. CPSI fixed to implement setflat changes from
		smooth to 16 sides at 9 (GS at 13), CPSI never has less than 16 sides.
		Resolution dependent (spec is 'output device pixels') and PLRM 3rd ed
		states "If the flatness parameter is large enough to cause visible
		straight line segments to appear, the result is unpredictable."
		When GS is run at 300 dpi (same resolution as Tek), the transition
		from smooth to 16 sides is at 7 (vs. 5 on the Tek) and from 16 to 8
		sides at 27 (vs. 19 on the Tek).
		-
		Since Tek and CPSI differ, and GS generally uses more line segments,
		the GS output conforms and is superior to the Tek output.

09-37-10  OK	GS matches Tek and CPSI output now matches Tek (12/04/06).

09-37-4  AOK	GS similar to Tek, but the value at which polygon edges changes to
		very coarse differs (GS at 73, Tek at 23). Also Tek changes from 'smooth'
		to bumpy at 5, GS at 19. When GS is run at 300 dpi, the transitions
		from smooth to bumpy is at 11, and from bumpy to very coarse at 39.
		Resolution dependent (spec is 'output device pixels'). CPSI fixed to
		implement setflat transitions to bumpy at 13 and to coarse at 33.
		-
		Since Tek and CPSI differ, and GS generally uses more line segments,
		the GS output conforms and is superior to the Tek output.

09-37-5  OK	Matches Tek hardcopy output. RJJ

09-37-8  DIFF	GS similar to Tek, but GS differs in the exact polygon shapes.
		Resolution dependent (spec is 'output device pixels'). GS at 300
		dpi has less edges on large outline in top two images. CPSI (at
		600 dpi) also smoother than GS on top two outlines.

                Analyzed by Igor.
                Likely CPSI problem.
                The test is buggy - insufficient data for function.
                It needs 16 samples, but 12 are only provided.
                GS adds zeros at end.
                000000ff 000000ff 
                00ffffff 00000000
                Thus the right end is Magenta+Yellow+Black =
                (1-green + 1-blue)*(1-black) =
                (1 + red)*(1-black).
                It is observing with GS.
                CPSI likely due to occasional data added at stream end.

		-
		Test07: aok
		Analyzed by Igor.
		The test is buggy : insufficient stream data,
		the effect does not correspond to the comment in the test.
		Due to insufficient data GS adds zeros at end,
		and the function becomes like this :
		000000 ff000000            ff00ff ffff0000
		000000 00000000            000000 00000000
		The DeviceN maps it to DeviceRGB with dropping the last 4 components,
		so we've got corner colors :
		black     magenta
		black     black
		That's what we observe with GS.
		There is a comment in gsdsrc.c ln 47 :
		/* Access data from a string or a byte object. */
		/* Does check bounds, and returns 0 data oob. Spec calls for rangecheck,
		   but CPSI implementation silently gives (bogus) data. */
		Tek paints       black   magenta
		                 black   red       - likely an occasional data at stream end.
		-
		Test10: aok
		Analyzed by Igor.
		A bug in the test : excessive stream data,
		the effect does not correspond to the comment in the test.
		The real effect is a linear sampled function like this :
		Cyan:    00 00
		         00 ff
		Magenta: 00 00
		         00 ff
		Yellow:  00 00
		         00 ff
		Black:   00 00
		         00 ff
		Thus it paints bad CMYK colors [v v v v] for various v.
		Same as 09-47B-11 Test05.
		I believe that [1 1 1 1] is very black, right ?
		Thus CPSI looks wrong.
		GS looks close to Tek.

                Test10: aok

                The linear sampled function is :
		000000 ff0000 
		00ff00 ffffff
                The function's domain by the 2nd argument
                is twice bigger than the shading domain.
                Therefore the function linear is cropped to this :
                007700 ff7777
                00ff00 ffffff
                With CPSI it looks like this (wrong) :
                000000 ff0000 
                00ff00 ffff77
                With GS it looks like this (correct) :
                007700 FF7777
                00ff00 777777
                CPSI appears wrong, GS appears correct.

		000000 770000 ff0000 
		007700 777733 ff7777
		00ff00 77ff77 ffffff
		Then crop with the "positive" quadrant :
		777733 ff7777
		77ff77 ffffff
		It looks close to what GS paints.
		CPSI paints something like this :
		770000 ff0000
		ffff77 7777ff
                CPSI appears wrong, GS appears correct.

09-47G-3  AOK	Test01: aok

			     00ff00 ffffff       green white
		It is truncated with BBox/Matrix = 0.909, 0.933
		So by theory we get:
		000000 e70000
		e60000 d1d1d1
		It looks so with GS.
		Don't know ehy CPSI misses green.

		1. The stroke starting point - same as 11-21-10.
		2. linewidth - same as 11-09-4.
		3. setflat - same as 09-09-1.
		4. CPSI doesn't roll a dash pattern at some corners.
		An example is at the lower right corner of the page.
		The dash at one corner looks longer than the distance to the corner.
		IMO it's another CPSI bug.
		Passing to Ray do decide what to to with it.

		Note: as of rev 7229, GS doesn't issue typecheck error when 'ucache'
		is not the first element. Differs from rev 7220. (see also 11-28-5)
		Rev. 7220 matches Distiller 5 but doesn't match Tek or CPSI, which
                ignore most of the user path errors. IMHO, all upath cases can
                be classified as AOK. Reassigning the case to Raph who owns all
                other upath cases. - Alex

		Test04:
		GS problem with non-contigous function.
		A fix is possible but isn't simple.
		A suggestion was posted to 'teco' on November 8
		and then dismissed. Now it arises anew.
		.
		First we need gs_function_evaluate to return a new bit.
		which tells that the function has a discontinuty at
		the point. Fortunately poly-argument PS finctions are
		always contigous (otherwise the topology of discontinuty
		would be a hell).
		.
		There are 20 calls to patch_interpolate_color,
		which deal with it. It must return a bit,
		which tells whether the function
		isn't contiguous at the point.
		If so, it must be called at second 
		time for computing another limit to this point.
		.
		The change should look like this :
		.
		+ typedef enum {left, right} function_limit_direction;
		.
		  { 
		- patch_color_t c;
		+ patch_color_t *C;
		+ function_limit_direction discontinuty;
		-  patch_interpolate_color(&c, c0, c1, pfs, 0.5);
		+  discontinuty = patch_interpolate_color(&c, c0, c1, pfs, 0.5, left);
		+   if (discontinuty) 
		+      patch_interpolate_color(&C, c0, c1, pfs, 0.5, right);
		+   else 
		+       C = &c;
		  // Then a half of occurances 'c' to be replaced with 'C'.
		  }
		.
		Assign to Ray to deside whether we should do this change.

                Likely CPSI problem.
                The test is buggy - insufficient data for function.
		The data are interpreter like this :
		000000ff000000 ff00ffffffxxxx
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
		where x is an insufficient data. GS pads it with zeros,
		CPSI is indeterministic.
		After tintTransform we get CMYK colors :
		000000ff ff00ffff       
		xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx       
		GS should paint :      black     black*green
		                       white     white
		It's what we observe.
		CPSI appears wrong.

12-14R-2  AOK	Worse smoothing with CPSI.

12-14R-3  DIFF	Analyzed by Igor.
		-
		Test07:
		Analyzed by Igor.
		The test looks buggy : duplicate DataSource.
		CPSI uses the first DataSource (padded with zeros at end), 
		and GS uses the second one while constructing the shading dictionary.
		GS interpretes the stream like this :
		000000ff 000000ff 
		00ffffff 00000000
		so the shading is not completely black - it is 1/256 gray in one corner.
		Note : lib/gs_*.ps files assume the usage of the last definition.
		I recall that at least gs_ttf.ps depends on that.
		Passing to Ray to decide what to do with it.
		assign: Ray.
		-
		Test08: aok - CPSI ingores Encode.
		It maps a haff of shading Domain outside (to negative values)
		of the function domain, so that shading must look constant at
		the riht half. That's what we see with GS.
		-
		Test09, 10, 11, 12: aok, same as Test07 except a different Encode.
		Note : the vertical 'spike' in Test10 is a false human visual effect.

12-14R-4  AOK	Test1: aok - A worse smoothing with CPSI.
		-
		Test12: aok : 
		The function itself :
		         000000 0000ff        black   blue
                         ff0000 00ff00        red     green
                         ff00ff 00ff00        magenta green 
                         ffff00 ffffff        yellow  white
                It is linear, but the green component has Decode 0 3,
                so it maps outside the color domain and 
                therefore it is cropped by the max color value 1.
                Due to the color croppig it has a plattue
                around the point where the green peak would apper.
                Then the function domain is cropped 
                with 300/400 = 0.75 by X
                and  500/600 = 0.83 by Y.
                Therefore we don't see yellow and white.
                GS paint it fine.
                CPSI has a bad smoothing and a linear gradient instead the plattue.

23-12A-3  AOK   The discrepancies are in the length of the encoded
                string produced by the ASCII85Encode and
                RunLengthEncode filter respectively.  These filters
                have some discretion in their output -- ASCII85Encode
                must insert a \n at least every 80 characters, but may
                insert one more often, and RunLengthEncode is not
                required to produce maximum-length runs -- and it
                appears that gs's implementation of these filters
                produces output that is 1 byte shorter than Adobe's in
                some cases.  gs's output is (also) correct -- the CET
                verifies it by decoding it and comparing against the
                original. (peter)
