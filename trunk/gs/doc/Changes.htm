size wasn't an exact multiple of the downsampling factor.
(doc/News.htm [1.31]: 2000/04/13 16:44:59 lpd)
	- When processing a PDF file, the font substitution heuristic based
on the FontName sometimes overrode the Flags information in the
FontDescriptor. (doc/News.htm [1.34]: 2000/04/20 06:36:02 lpd)

Adds projects related to SVG and to pswrite image compression.
(doc/Projects.htm [1.4]: 2000/04/07 18:39:12 lpd)

Makes the ps2pdf scripts replace a .eps extension with .pdf, as they do with
.ps. (doc/Ps2pdf.htm [1.7], man/ps2pdf.1 [1.5], man/ps2pdfwr.1 [1.2]:
2000/04/07 19:28:14 lpd)

Completely redesigns the representation of CMaps, to reduce space
requirements and make comparing them more reasonable, changing gs_cmap to
gs_cmap_t and gx_code_map to gx_code_map_t. (****** NOTE ****** The
PostScript code currently only handles a few well-behaved CMap structures.)
(doc/News.htm [1.27]: 2000/04/08 03:54:38 lpd)

Documents the need to set SYNC=nosync on NextStep / OpenStep systems.
(doc/Make.htm [1.10]: 2000/04/10 04:45:37 lpd)

Overhauls font embedding in the PDF writer: splits off the code into a new
file (gdevpdfe.c), writes embedded Type 1 fonts as Type 1C (CFF Type 2), and
adds a little bit of code for future support of Type 0 and CID-keyed fonts.

Factors out code for writing functions and for adding filter-related entries
to a stream dictionary; implements the DefaultRenderingIntent distiller
parameter. (doc/Ps2pdf.htm [1.8]: 2000/04/11 16:06:57 lpd)

Implements additional distiller parameters: PreserveHalftoneInfo,
PreserveOverprintSetting, TransferFunctionInfo (except for Apply vs.
Remove), UCRandBGInfo. Splits off graphics state management into separate
files. Implements the remaining graphics state parameters (halftone,
transfer function, black generation, undercolor removal, halftone phase,
smoothness, overprint, stroke adjustment) ****** EXCEPT FOR IMAGES ******.
In anticipation of handling more general colors, renames pdf_set_color as
pdf_set_pure_color, and adds pdf_set_drawing_color. (doc/News.htm [1.29]:
2000/04/11 18:31:32 lpd)

Updates documentation to match recent changes in the pdfwrite driver.
(doc/Ps2pdf.htm [1.9]: 2000/04/11 22:56:17 lpd)

Makes the second argument of the pfbtopfa script optional, so 'pfbtopfa
dir/x.pfb' is equivalent to 'pfbtopfa dir/x.pfb x.pfa'.
(man/pfbtopfa.1 [1.2]: 2000/04/12 17:41:41 lpd)

In pdfwrite, rewrites the image writing code to use Cos objects rather than
direct printing, and splits off the creation of image dictionaries into a

</pre><h2><a name="6.21 Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Some makefile macros were used before being defined.
(devs.mak [1.9], lib.mak [1.9]: 2000/04/07 16:02:03 lpd)
	- `make install-data' didn't install lib/gs_frsd.ps or
lib/pdfopt.ps. (unixinst.mak [1.7]: 2000/04/07 19:17:48 lpd)
	- gsmake would get into a loop if the makefile was not a symbolic
link; `gsmake check' didn't accept a makefile name on the command line.
(toolbin/gsmake.tcl [1.2]: 2000/04/07 19:37:21 lpd)
	- `makemaster' referred to an undefined variable. (How could it ever
have worked?) (toolbin/makeset.tcl [1.3]: 2000/04/07 19:39:27 lpd)
	- A dependency wasn't updated when moving the gdevpsf* rules from
devs.mak to lib.mak. (lib.mak [1.10]: 2000/04/07 19:40:25 lpd)
	- The dependencies in the makefile weren't updated for the pdfwrite
font embedding overhaul. (devs.mak [1.11]: 2000/04/10 18:57:33 lpd)
	- Once again, the dependencies hadn't been updated. (int.mak [1.17]:
2000/04/11 15:59:42 lpd)
	- Setting pdfwrite parameters for a DCTEncode filter could cause a
crash (memory fault). (devs.mak [1.16]: 2000/04/13 01:53:07 lpd)
	- `make install' didn't install all the documentation files.
(unixinst.mak [1.9]: 2000/04/14 04:06:13 lpd)

Completely redesigns the representation of CMaps, to reduce space
requirements and make comparing them more reasonable, changing gs_cmap to
gs_cmap_t and gx_code_map to gx_code_map_t. (****** NOTE ****** The
PostScript code currently only handles a few well-behaved CMap structures.)
(int.mak [1.16]: 2000/04/08 03:54:38 lpd)

Updates version #s to 6.21. (We should have done this earlier.)
(version.mak [1.12]: 2000/04/10 04:46:36 lpd)

Overhauls font embedding in the PDF writer: splits off the code into a new
file (gdevpdfe.c), writes embedded Type 1 fonts as Type 1C (CFF Type 2), and
adds a little bit of code for future support of Type 0 and CID-keyed fonts.
(devs.mak [1.10]: 2000/04/10 07:48:37 lpd)

Adds Function-based tint_transform procedures for Separation and DeviceN
color spaces. (lib.mak [1.11]: 2000/04/10 19:02:19 lpd)

transfer function, black generation, undercolor removal, halftone phase,
smoothness, overprint, stroke adjustment) ****** EXCEPT FOR IMAGES ******.
In anticipation of handling more general colors, renames pdf_set_color as
pdf_set_pure_color, and adds pdf_set_drawing_color. (devs.mak [1.13]:
2000/04/11 18:31:32 lpd)

Splits off creation and writing of color spaces, and writing color values,
into a separate file. Adds support for (Function-based) Separation and
DeviceN color spaces, general Pattern color spaces, and procedure-based
Indexed color spaces. Adds some code to support Pattern colors, but stubs it
out because it depends on changes in the image writing code that haven't
been integrated yet. In fact, most of the new code isn't called yet, either.
(devs.mak [1.14]: 2000/04/11 19:10:13 lpd)

In pdfwrite, rewrites the image writing code to use Cos objects rather than
direct printing, and splits off the creation of image dictionaries into a

Adds user-contributed uniprint parameter files for the Canon BJC-8200,
including an addition for the Red Hat printer data base.
(unixinst.mak [1.8]: 2000/04/14 03:59:57 lpd)

Adds code to write out CMaps, similar to the code for writing fonts, for
eventual embedding in PDF output. (int.mak [1.18], lib.mak [1.12]:
2000/04/14 07:17:24 lpd)

Completes code for reading and writing CMaps. (int.mak [1.19],
lib.mak [1.13]: 2000/04/16 03:05:29 lpd)

Adds a user-contributed driver for the Epson Stylus (Color) Photo printers.
(contrib.mak [1.6]: 2000/04/18 06:34:26 lpd)

Converts the ps2epsi documentation to HTML. (unixinst.mak [1.10]: 2000/04/18
17:59:13 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.21 Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- The e-mail address for reporting problems was out of date.
(lib/ps2epsi.ps [1.2]: 2000/04/10 02:27:21 lpd)
	- If a font didn't have a FontName (which is the case for bitmap
fonts produced by recent versions of dvips), ps2epsi caused an error.
(lib/ps2epsi.ps [1.3]: 2000/04/11 16:32:51 lpd)
	- Backs out contributed changes of 2000-03-05 because of bugs.
(ansi2knr.c [1.3]: 2000/04/13 03:41:48 lpd)

Makes the ps2pdf scripts replace a .eps extension with .pdf, as they do with
.ps. (lib/ps2pdfwr [1.2], lib/ps2pdfxx.bat [1.2]: 2000/04/07 19:28:14 lpd)

Enhances pdf2ps to allow defaulting the output file name. (lib/pdf2ps [1.2]:
2000/04/11 14:23:24 lpd)

Makes the second argument of the pfbtopfa script optional, so 'pfbtopfa
dir/x.pfb' is equivalent to 'pfbtopfa dir/x.pfb x.pfa'. (lib/pfbtopfa [1.2]:
2000/04/12 17:41:41 lpd)

Adds user-contributed uniprint parameter files for the Canon BJC-8200,
including an addition for the Red Hat printer data base. (lib/bj8.rpd [1.1]:
2000/04/14 03:59:57 lpd)

Increases the VMThreshold when converting PostScript to PDF, to reduce
garbage collection overhead. (lib/ps2pdfwr [1.3]: 2000/04/17 19:06:58 lpd)

Moves the optimization prologue for ps2pdf from the command line to a
procedure, to avoid shell length limits. (lib/ps2pdfwr [1.4],
lib/ps2pdfxx.bat [1.3]: 2000/04/18 16:40:14 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.21 Drivers"></a>Drivers</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- The pdfwrite driver sometimes compressed images in an Indexed
color space with the DCTEncode filter, producing garbage. (gdevpsdi.c [1.4]:
2000/04/12 19:25:56 lpd)
	- Setting pdfwrite parameters for a DCTEncode filter could cause a
crash (memory fault). (gdevpsdf.h [1.7], gdevpsdi.c [1.5], gdevpsdp.c [1.4],
gdevpsdu.c [1.2]: 2000/04/13 01:53:07 lpd)
	- Compressing with DCTEncode tried to add the compression filter
twice. (gdevpsdi.c [1.6]: 2000/04/13 04:52:38 lpd)
	- The PDF writer could get an ioerror when downsampling images whose

freed at the end of each page. (gdevpdf.c [1.9]: 2000/04/10 04:17:56 lpd)
	- gdevpdfe.c was omitted from the check-in for the overhaul of
pdfwrite font embedding. (gdevpdfe.c [1.1]: 2000/04/10 16:01:29 lpd)
	- pdfwrite output could contain commands to set the line width to a
negative value, which PostScript allows but PDF doesn't. (gdevpdfd.c [1.6]:
2000/04/12 19:51:14 lpd)
	- The changes for the new color handling code caused stroked
graphics not to output the line width. (new bug since 6.20)
(gdevpdfd.c [1.7]: 2000/04/13 03:47:21 lpd)
	- Pattern resources were written with incorrectly scaled XStep and

(zfunc4.c [1.3]: 2000/04/09 20:04:00 lpd)
	- the most recent 'fixes' for loading font resources caused all

	- Attempting to set a PageSize with 4 elements actually set the
PageSize (to the first 2 elements), rather than ignoring the attempt. (This
is just a patch to prevent some PageMaker files from being thrown off by the
4-element PageSizes in Input Attributes.) (lib/gs_setpd.ps [1.2]: 2000/04/19

(lib/gs_cmap.ps [1.2], zfcmap.c [1.4], zfont0.c [1.2]: 2000/04/08 03:54:38
lpd)

Updates version #s to 6.21. (We should have done this earlier.)
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.7]: 2000/04/10 04:46:36 lpd)

Makes Separation and DeviceN color spaces detect that their tint transform
procedure is a Function, and call it rather than using its cached values.
(zcsdevn.c [1.2], zcssepr.c [1.3]: 2000/04/10 19:39:44 lpd)

Adds code to write out CMaps, similar to the code for writing fonts, for
eventual embedding in PDF output. (zfcmap.c [1.5]: 2000/04/14 07:17:24 lpd)

Completes code for reading and writing CMaps. (lib/gs_cmap.ps [1.4],
zfcmap.c [1.7]: 2000/04/16 03:05:29 lpd)

Works around a bug in the AdobePS5 Windows driver, which emits CMaps lacking
the required CMapName entry. (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.15], lib/gs_cmap.ps [1.5]:
2000/04/18 07:18:42 lpd)

Moves the optimization prologue for ps2pdf from the command line to a
procedure, to avoid shell length limits. (lib/gs_pdfwr.ps [1.3]: 2000/04/18
16:40:14 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.21 Streams"></a>Streams</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- FILE_IMPLEMENTATION=both was broken (by the introduction of
sread_subfile). (sfxfd.c [1.3]: 2000/04/10 02:41:48 lpd)
	- flushfile and closefile didn't properly flush streams whose final
target was a procedure, and closefile didn't actually close them. (This is a
very old bug.) (stream.c [1.6]: 2000/04/18 05:50:15 lpd)

Enhances the ASCII85Encode filter to avoid %! at the beginning of a line of
output, in addition to avoiding %% which it did already. (sa85x.h [1.2],
sfilter2.c [1.2]: 2000/04/08 01:30:36 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.21 Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Fixes some signed/unsigned char * mismatches. (gdevpsf2.c [1.5]:
2000/04/07 15:27:14 lpd)
	- Writing a Type 2 CFF with multiply-encoded glyphs produced an
incorrect Encoding. Also, when producing output for PDF 1.2 files, no longer
emits certain opcodes that cause an (unjustified) error in Acrobat Reader 3
for Linux. (gdevpsf.h [1.3], gdevpsf2.c [1.6]: 2000/04/10 07:42:31 lpd)
	- gsmisc.c didn't compile in DEBUG mode on systems with a
non-standard prototype for the sqrt function. (gsmisc.c [1.3]: 2000/04/10
16:00:31 lpd)
	- One picky compiler complained about (1L << 31). (gsmisc.c [1.4]:
2000/04/10 17:21:41 lpd)
	- putdeviceparams allowed a PageSize or .MediaSize value with the
wrong number of elements to take effect. (gsdparam.c [1.2]: 2000/04/19
05:59:05 lpd)

Completely redesigns the representation of CMaps, to reduce space
requirements and make comparing them more reasonable, changing gs_cmap to
gs_cmap_t and gx_code_map to gx_code_map_t. (****** NOTE ****** The
PostScript code currently only handles a few well-behaved CMap structures.)
(gsfcmap.c [1.4], gsfcmap.h [1.2], gxfcmap.h [1.3], gxfont0.h [1.2]:
2000/04/08 03:54:38 lpd)

Adds Function-based tint_transform procedures for Separation and DeviceN
color spaces. (gscdevn.c [1.3], gscdevn.h [1.2], gscsepr.c [1.3],
gscsepr.h [1.2]: 2000/04/10 19:02:19 lpd)

Adds code to write out CMaps, similar to the code for writing fonts, for
eventual embedding in PDF output. (gdevpsf.h [1.4], gdevpsfm.c [1.1]:
2000/04/14 07:17:24 lpd)

Completes code for reading and writing CMaps. (gdevpsf.h [1.5],
gdevpsfm.c [1.2], gsccode.h [1.3], gsfcid.c [1.3], gsfcmap.c [1.5],
gxcid.h [1.2], gxfcmap.h [1.4]: 2000/04/16 03:05:29 lpd)
