Fixes problems:
	- egcc - 2.91.66 generates incorrect code for dda_step_add(dxx4,
dxx4); Using the intermediate variable now to wark around the problem. This
bug corrupted memory block headers and caused random crashes.
(gxifast.c [1.3]: 2001/01/25 21:36:17 alexcher)

Changes gx_image_cached_char so that it now images to the device in the text
enumeration, rather than the current device. This change gives more
flexibility for implementations of begin_text to interpose a device of their
own for actual imaging. (gxccache.c [1.3]: 2001/01/04 19:39:24 raph)

Updates documentation in gxdevcli.h on creating device instances.
