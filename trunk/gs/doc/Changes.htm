<h2><a name="6.23 Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Local GC in a multi-context system caused a crash. Also updates
all the internal type names in zcontext.c by adding a _t suffix if
necessary. (doc/News.htm [1.54]: 2000/07/10 23:56:55 lpd)

Increments the version number, in preparation for the next fileset.
(doc/News.htm [1.52]: 2000/07/06 02:45:06 lpd)

Adds a finish_copydevice device procedure, for cleaning up after copying the
bits of a device prototype or instance. For safety, the default
implementation only allows copying the prototype, not instances. This is a
NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change; however, using copydevice on a device
instance never worked reliably, so it should not have been used this way
before. (doc/Drivers.htm [1.4], doc/News.htm [1.53]: 2000/07/06 04:13:24
lpd)

Updates the references to the Computer Modern Fontmap on CTAN.
(doc/Fonts.htm [1.5], doc/New-user.htm [1.8]: 2000/07/09 23:29:25 lpd)

Updates a couple of release procedures. (doc/Release.htm [1.15]: 2000/07/10
19:32:59 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- $(GLGEN)/md5.h wasn't deleted after compilation. (lib.mak [1.26]:
2000/07/09 23:19:59 lpd)

Increments the version number, in preparation for the next fileset.
(version.mak [1.17]: 2000/07/06 02:45:06 lpd)

Adds some user-contributed comments about using the Canon BJ200 driver with
the BJ300. (contrib.mak [1.18]: 2000/07/11 15:33:19 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- An invalid file name or pattern passed to filenameforall would
(incorrectly) return an empty string rather than not returning any file
names at all. (gp_vms.c [1.3]: 2000/07/09 21:09:51 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 Drivers"></a>Drivers</h2><pre>

Implements finish_copydevice for X windows, to allow copying instances as
well as the prototype. (gdevx.c [1.4], gdevx.h [1.3], gdevxini.c [1.7]:
2000/07/06 05:29:46 lpd)

Adds some user-contributed comments about using the Canon BJ200 driver with
the BJ300. (gdevbj10.c [1.2]: 2000/07/11 15:33:19 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 PDF writer"></a>PDF writer</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- M_2PI was predefined on some systems. (gdevpdfg.c [1.6]:
2000/07/09 23:11:31 lpd)
	- The word and character spacing values were not tracked correctly
when mixing text and graphics, sometimes producing horizontally misplaced
text. (gdevpdf.c [1.18], gdevpdfg.c [1.7], gdevpdfu.c [1.10],
gdevpdfx.h [1.19]: 2000/07/11 14:33:54 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 Interpreter (PDF)"></a>Interpreter (PDF)</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- If a badly-constructed PDF file referenced one of the 12 base
alphabetic fonts explicitly as a TrueType font (e.g., /BaseFont
/TimesNewRoman /Subtype /TrueType) without embedding it, the substituted
Type 1 font had the wrong Encoding. (lib/pdf_font.ps [1.10]: 2000/07/10
13:18:28 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 Interpreter"></a>Interpreter</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Removes the '?' procedure, which was defined solely for the
convenience of users who don't read the documentation and which interfered
with the operation of some code produced by the Adobe PS5 Windows driver.
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.18]: 2000/07/09 22:34:30 lpd)
	- A constant 1 should have been 1L, causing a warning on systems
where sizeof(long) > sizeof(int). (zarith.c [1.3]: 2000/07/09 23:10:58 lpd)
	- The workaround for attempting to set a 4-element PageSize value in
a page device sometimes caused an error. (bug introduced in 6.21)
(lib/gs_setpd.ps [1.4]: 2000/07/10 12:48:54 lpd)
	- Redefining setcolorspace could cause an infinite recursion.
(lib/gs_lev2.ps [1.5]: 2000/07/10 13:35:24 lpd)
	- Local GC in a multi-context system caused a crash. Also updates
all the internal type names in zcontext.c by adding a _t suffix if
necessary. (zcontext.c [1.4]: 2000/07/10 23:56:55 lpd)

Increments the version number, in preparation for the next fileset.
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.15]: 2000/07/06 02:45:06 lpd)

Redefines [gs_]copydevice in terms of a new gs_copydevice2/.copydevice2,
which adds a Boolean keep_open argument that requests (but does not
guarantee) that a copy of an open device remain open.
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.16], zdevice.c [1.2]: 2000/07/06 03:26:13 lpd)

Adds a finish_copydevice device procedure, for cleaning up after copying the
bits of a device prototype or instance. For safety, the default
implementation only allows copying the prototype, not instances. This is a
NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change; however, using copydevice on a device
instance never worked reliably, so it should not have been used this way
before. (lib/gs_init.ps [1.17]: 2000/07/06 04:13:24 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.23 Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Some coordinate computations for Type 1 fonts could lose far too
much precision if _fixed_shift was reduced. (gscoord.c [1.2],
gxmatrix.h [1.2]: 2000/07/11 09:25:46 lpd)
	- If the current color space was DeviceRGB, gs_currentgray returned
the wrong value. (bug introduced in 6.22) (gscolor.c [1.3]: 2000/07/11
14:00:09 lpd)

Increments the version number, in preparation for the next fileset.
(gscdef.c [1.5]: 2000/07/06 02:45:06 lpd)

Redefines [gs_]copydevice in terms of a new gs_copydevice2/.copydevice2,
which adds a Boolean keep_open argument that requests (but does not
guarantee) that a copy of an open device remain open. (gsdevice.c [1.5],
gsdevice.h [1.2]: 2000/07/06 03:26:13 lpd)

Adds a finish_copydevice device procedure, for cleaning up after copying the

implementation only allows copying the prototype, not instances. This is a
NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change; however, using copydevice on a device

gdevmem.h [1.2], gdevnfwd.c [1.2], gdevprn.h [1.5], gdevrops.c [1.2],

gxpcmap.c [1.2]: 2000/07/06 04:13:24 lpd)

Adds a little more tracing output for images. (gxidata.c [1.3]: 2000/07/09
21:04:25 lpd)

Adds _simple_final structure type definition macros. (gsstruct.h [1.3]:
2000/07/10 15:43:30 lpd)
