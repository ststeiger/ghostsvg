Artifex Software is committed to producing code with as few bugs as 
possible. As such, we have a [http://bugs.ghostscript.com/ public bug 
tracker] where anyone is welcome to view open issues, report new ones, 
and contribute analysis and fixes.
 
When we have bugs that we'd like to get fixed, but don't have time to 
work on immediately ourselves, we throw them open to the public and 
offer bounties for accepted fixes.
These are marked with the 
[http://bugs.ghostscript.com/buglist.cgi?keywords=bountiable&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED 'bountiable'] 
keyword in the tracker.

Accepted fixes for bugs at P1 and P2 pay a bounty of US$1000 each. Bugs 
at lower priority pay US$500 per bug.

This is a great way to get involved in Ghostscript development and make
a little cash at the same time. If you start working on a bug, just let 
us know by posting a comment on the bug. Fixes are first come, first 
served, within reason. Final arbitration is up to Artifex.

Some of the bugs reference specific files to reproduce the problem; 
these are generally given as attachments on the bugs themselves, the
a fix must resolve the issue for the file in question. In cases where 
these files are commercially sensitive, we cannot make them publicly 
available. If you'd like to try tackling such a bug, contact us, and we
can arrange for you to sign an NDA, after which you can access the 
private attachments and other confidential files.

Our ultimate goal is to get more people involved in the project and 
improve the quality of the program. Have at!
