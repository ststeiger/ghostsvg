@Artifex Software offers bounties for accepted fixes on some of the issues in our [http://bugs.ghostscript.com/ tracker]. These are marked with the [http://bugs.ghostscript.com/buglist.cgi?keywords=bountiable&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED 'bountiable'] keyword.

Bugs at P1 and P2 pay a bounty of US$1000 each. Bugs at lower priority pay US$500.

This is a great way to get involved in Ghostscript development and make a little cash at the same time. If you start working on a bug, just let us know by posting a comment on the bug. Fixes are first come, first served, within reason. Final arbitration is up to Artifex.

Have at!
