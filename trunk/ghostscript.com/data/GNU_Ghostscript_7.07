We're pleased to announce the availablity of GNU Ghostscript 7.07, the third GPL release of the stable 7.0x branch. The reason for this release so soon after 7.06 is to fix an important security issue with the %pipe% io device. In addition there are a few bugfixes and further improved conformance with GNU project guidelines.

The 7.07 release is available from
[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1897&release_id=160061 sourceforge]
and 
[ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/gs707/ wisc.edu] as per usual.

Free Software users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.
