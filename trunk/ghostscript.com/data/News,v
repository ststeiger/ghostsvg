@= [GPL Ghostscript 8.60]

Posted 2007 May 11 by rillian

Artifex Software, Inc. and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce a new stable release, GPL Ghostscript 8.57.

= [GPL Ghostscript 8.56]

Posted 2007 April 19

Artifex Software, Inc. and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the release of GPL Ghostscript 8.56. This is the latest in our stable 8.5x series, and the first new release since we began developing under the GPL.

In addition to numerous bug fixes, conformance with published test suites is much improved in this release.

= Ghostscript leading edge is now GPL!

Posted 7 Jun 2006 by raph

I have some great news to report. The leading edge of Ghostscript development is now under GPL license, as is the latest release, Ghostscript 8.54.

By switching to the GPL, we're reaffirming our commitment to the free software world. One big reason for this decision was to reduce the lead time between bugs being fixed in the development tree and users seeing the fixes, especially those users dependent on Linux distributions.

Moving forward, we'd also like to resolve the effective fork with "ESP Ghostscript," so that our development tree is suitable directly for use in Linux distributions without a lot of extra patches. It would be very nice if all the GPL patches could be incorporated into the main tree without any license restrictions (which means that we need copyright assignment), but realistically, we'll still have to implement an apartheid system of some kind, so that a GPL-only subdirectory exists that gets deleted out of our commercial releases.

= Ghostscript [Bug Bounty program]

Posted 29 Mar 2005 by rillian

Artifex Software, Inc. is pleased to announce a new Bug Bounty Program!

Earlier programs were quite successful, but since the 8.50 stable release we've accumulated a number of new boutiable bugs, so we're starting the program up again. As before we're paying US $500 for bugs marked bountiable in the tracker; $1000 for those set with priority P1 or P2! So if you're a coder, here's your chance for a little extra cash.

Posted 21 Nov 2004 by rillian
