Artifex Software, Inc. is pleased to announe the release of
GPL Ghostscript 8.60. This is the first in a new stable series.

The major milestone of this release is a merge from the
ESP Ghostscript fork, used to support the CUPS printing
system. This means that free operating systems can now
ship a single copy of upstream Ghostscript with their
releases. Thanks to Till Kamppeter and Mike Sweet for
making this possible.

This release also includes numerous important bug fixes over
the previous stable versions, as well as improvements to
performance, memory footprint, shading and image handling.
We recommend this upgrade to all free users.

<b>Note:</b> The default device in the gcc build is temporarily the 'bbox' device instead of the usual 'x11' device. This is a side effect of the device modularization patch from ESP Ghostscript which could not be corrected before release. To recover the old default behaviour add '-sDEVICE=x11' to the command line.
