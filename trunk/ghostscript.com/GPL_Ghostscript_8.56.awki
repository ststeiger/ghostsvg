Artifex Software, Inc. and artofcode LLC are pleased to announce the 
release of GPL Ghostscript 8.56. This is the latest in the 8.5x stable
series.

This new release has seen a great deal of work to improve conformance 
with the Quality Logic PS CET suite. Where close imitation of the 
reference implementation is required, we now provide a 'gs_cet.ps'
helper file which can be prefixed to a job to set certain optional
defaults.

Also new in this release:

* Better support for 64 bit platforms.

* The .ps library files and Resources tree are now compiled into Ghostscript by default. This means -Ilib is no longer needed when running gs uninstalled. Run './configure --disable-compile-inits' or set COMPILE_INITS=0 in the makefile to recover the old behaviour. The library files are still installed for reference.

* New '-o <outputfile>' convenience option for writing output to a file. This is equivalent to '-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sOutputFile=<outputfile>'.

* Numerous bug fixes and rendering improvements.

See the file doc/Changes.htm in the distribution for a complete list of 
changes.
