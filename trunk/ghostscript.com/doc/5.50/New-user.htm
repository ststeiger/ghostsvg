<h1><a name="Overview"></a>An overview of Ghostscript</h1>

<p>
Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

<ul>
<li>an interpreter for the <b>PostScript</b><small><sup>TM</sup></small>
language and the Adobe <b>Portable Document Format</b> (<b>PDF</b> --
sometimes confused with Acrobat, Adobe's PDF browser and editor product),
and

<li>The Ghostscript library, a set of procedures to implement the graphics
and filtering capabilities that are primitive operations in the PostScript
language and in PDF.
</ul>

<p>
In simple terms, this means that Ghostscript can read a PostScript or PDF
file and display the results on the screen or convert them into a form you
can print on a non-PostScript printer. Especially together with several
popular <a href="#Previewers">previewers</a>, with Ghostscript you can view
or print an entire document or even isolated pages, even if your computer
doesn't have Display PostScript and your printer doesn't handle PostScript
itself.

<h2><a name="Find_Ghostscript"></a>How is Ghostscript licensed?  Where can I find it?</h2>

<p>
Ghostscript is a copyrighted work (Aladdin Enterprises owns the copyright);
it is not shareware or in the public domain.  Different versions of it are
distributed with three different licenses:

<h3><a name="Aladdin_gs"></a>Aladdin Ghostscript</h3>

<p>
Versions entitled "Aladdin Ghostscript" are distributed with a license
called the <a href="Public.htm">Aladdin Free Public License</a> that allows
free use, copying, and distribution by end users, but does not allow
commercial distribution.  You can get the current version of Aladdin
Ghostscript with this license from

<blockquote>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/">ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/</a>gs###/ghostscript#.##
</blockquote>

<p>
or under AFS by direct reference to

<blockquote>
/afs/cs.wisc.edu/public/ghost/aladdin/gs###/ghostscript#.##
</blockquote>

<p>
where "#.##" and "###" are the version number with and without punctuation,
for instance "5.10" and "510".  You can also search for ftp access to
Ghostscript at other sites, perhaps nearer your site, using the excellent
ftp search service

<blockquote>
<a href="http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/">http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
A general search engine like

<blockquote>
<a href="http://altavista.digital.com/">http://altavista.digital.com/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
may also be useful, but in searching for files is likely to provide many
unusable references mixed in among the useful ones.

<p>
If you haven't convenient access to the Internet, you can order Aladdin
Ghostscript on a CD along with some useful related programs and
documentation.  <b>Please note</b> that this is not "commercial licensing":
you are still getting freely redistributable software, with no support and
no warranty.  For more information write to <a href="#GSview">Russell
Lang</a> or see

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/cd.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/cd.html</a>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="GNU_gs"></a>GNU Ghostscript</h3>

<p>
Versions entitled "GNU Ghostscript" are distributed with the GNU
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a>,
which allows free use, and free copying and redistribution under certain
conditions (including, in some cases, commercial distribution).  GNU
Ghostscript versions are released more than a year after the corresponding
Aladdin Ghostscript version.  You can always get the current version of GNU
Ghostscript by Internet FTP from

<blockquote>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/gnu/">ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/gnu/</a>gs###/ghostscript#.##
</blockquote>

<p>
or under AFS by direct reference to

<blockquote>
/afs/cs.wisc.edu/public/ghost/gnu/gs###/ghostscript#.##
</blockquote>

<p>
or from any of the many GNU distribution sites.  The GNU home ftp site is

<blockquote>
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
For a more complete list of sites, including sites outside the U.S., write
to <a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">gnu@gnu.org</a>.  The
<a href="Commprod.htm#FSF-address">Free Software Foundation</a> makes GNU
Ghostscript available on tape and CD-ROM.

<p><a name="CTAN_gs"></a>
Both Aladdin and GNU versions are also available from sites in the
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN), in a tree based at
/tex-archive/support/ghostscript/, which you can find at these principal
CTAN distribution sites ("participating hosts") as of mid-1998:

<blockquote><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

<p>
CTAN has more than fifty mirror sites around the world.  For information
about CTAN sites, including how to use them over the World Wide Web, get
the file <b><tt>CTAN.sites</tt></b> from any CTAN server, for
instance

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Commercial_gs"></a>Commercial versions</h3>

<p>
Finally, Ghostscript is also available for commercial licensing.  See
"<a href="#Commercial_use">What about commercial use?</a>" for details.

<p>
Aladdin Ghostscript and GNU Ghostscript come with <b>NO WARRANTY</b> and
<b>NO SUPPORT</b>.  If you have a question or a bug to report, please see
"<a href="#Need_help">If you need help</a>" for information about what to
do.

<hr>

<h2><a name="Third-party_libraries"></a>Libraries obtained from other parties</h2>

<p>
The Ghostscript source code distribution, and the Ghostscript executable
code, include libraries obtained from other parties.  All the source files
mentioned in this section are in the Ghostscript and third-party library
source kits.  The documentation of <a href="Make.htm">how to build
Ghostscript</a> tells <a href="Make.htm#Acquiring">where to get these
libraries</a> and <a href="Make.htm#Unpack">how to unpack them</a>.

<blockquote><dl>
<dt>The <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">Independent JPEG Group</a> (IJG)
library
<dd>The executable versions of Ghostscript are based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group.  For more information, see
<b><tt>jpeg.mak</tt></b> in the main Ghostscript source directory and
<b><tt>README</tt></b> in the <b><tt>jpeg</tt></b> subdirectory of the
Ghostscript source code

Ghostscript source directory, and <b><tt>README</tt></b> in the
<b><tt>zlib</tt></b> subdirectory of the Ghostscript source code.
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
These libraries do <b>NOT</b> fall under either the GNU License or the
Aladdin Free Public License; they come with their own licenses,
which also allow free use and redistribution under appropriate
circumstances and which appear in the files mentioned just above.  These
libraries are entirely original works of their respective authors, and are
provided <b>AS IS</b> with <b>NO WARRANTY</b> and <b>NO SUPPORT</b>.

<hr>

<h2><a name="Support"></a>What if I want support?</h2>

<p>
Neither Aladdin Enterprises nor any organization known to us currently
offers Ghostscript support for end-users -- that is, for people or
companies who just want to use Ghostscript and not redistribute it as part
of a product.  Companies that include Ghostscript in their products under a
commercial license (see next section) may offer support to end-users, but
it would be support for the company's own product, not for Ghostscript
<em>per se</em>.

<p>
Nothing in the GNU or Aladdin Free licenses prevents anyone from providing
support for Ghostscript, either free or commercial.  Aladdin would be happy
to include in the Ghostscript documentation the contact information for
anyone who wants to offer such support.

<hr>

<h2><a name="Commercial_use"></a>What about commercial use?</h2>

<p>
GNU Ghostscript may not be incorporated into commercial products which
forbid copying or for which customers cannot obtain source code for no more
than the cost of reproduction, although it may be distributed
("aggregated") with commercial products; Aladdin Ghostscript may not be
incorporated into commercial products at all, and may be distributed
commercially only under extremely limited circumstances.  However,
Ghostscript is also available for commercial licensing, which in addition
to the right to incorporate Ghostscript into commercial products includes
support, a limited warranty, high-quality fonts, and other benefits.  For
more information about commercial licensing of Ghostscript, please contact
Aladdin Enterprises' commercial distribution partner, the only entity
legally authorized to distribute Ghostscript <em>per se</em> on any terms
other than the GNU or Aladdin free licenses:

<p>
Artifex does not offer commercial support as a separate service; support is
available only to OEM licensees (that is, licensees who redistribute
Ghostscript in a product).

<hr>

<h2><a name="Platforms"></a>What platforms does Ghostscript run on?</h2>

<p>
Ghostscript is written entirely in C (with some optional assembly-language
accelerators for DOS platforms), with special care taken to make it run
properly on systems of either byte order ("low-endian" and "high-endian")
and of various word lengths.  GNU Ghostscript is known to run on the
following platform families:

<ul>
<li>A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11, releases 4, 5,
and 6, including

<ul compact>
<li>Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i, Sun SPARCStation with SunOS 4 and Solaris 2.[56]
<li>Generic Intel-based systems running Linux, 386/ix, 386BSD, FreeBSD, ISC Unix, SCO Unix, and Solaris
<li>H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800
<li>DECStation 2100, 3100, and 5xxx
<li>Alpha systems running Digital Unix
<li>VAX running Ultrix
<li>Sequent Symmetry
<li>Convex C1 and C2
<li>Tektronix 4300
<li>SGI Iris Indigo
<li>4.4BSD Unix systems (FreeBSD on Intel)
<li>NetBSD on Intel, Sun SPARC, Motorola M68K (Apple, Amiga, Sun, H-P), and VAX
</ul>

<li>Sun workstations running SunView

<li>VAX and Alpha systems running OpenVMS with X11 compiled with
either DEC C or gcc
</ul>

<p>
Aladdin Ghostscript is known to run on all of the above, and additionally
on the following platform families:

<ul>
<li>IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, 5.0, or 6.22, and Microsoft Windows 3.1, NT, 95, or 98;

<li>IBM PC and compatibles under DR DOS 6.0;

<li>IBM PC and compatibles under OS/2 2.0, 2.1 and Warp 3.0.

<li>Apple Macintosh with System 7 or later, both Motorola 680x0 and PowerPC
native. For specific information on the Macintosh implementation, see

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/mac/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/mac/</a>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
It is very likely that Ghostscript will run under other versions of DOS,
and other versions of Unix that support X11, but it has not been tested in
these environments.  (Ghostscript does not run well on PC-compatibles with
Hercules display cards, since text and graphics output interfere with each
other, but you can work around this by redirecting the text output to a file.)

<p>
Ghostscript has also been ported to a number of platforms by users, who are
willing to be contacted about problems on those specific platforms:

<h1><a name="Related_work"></a>Related work</h1>

<h2><a name="PDF_encryption"></a>PDF encryption</h2>

<p>
Geoff Keating has created code to allow processing encrypted PDF files.
Unfortunately, current U.S. export control laws don't allow redistribution
of this code from a site in the U.S., even though it's freely available to
anyone anywhere in the world from Geoff's site in Australia:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pdfencrypt/">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pdfencrypt/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
The change is a single file of PostScript code, <b><tt>pdf_sec.ps</tt></b>,
which replaces a file in the standard Ghostscript fileset, so it can be
added to a running version of Ghostscript without rebuilding anything.  A
full explanation and instructions are on Geoff's page.

<hr>

<h2><a name="Previewers"></a>Previewers</h2>

<p>
The Ghostscript user interface is very primitive, so several people have
contributed screen previewers with better user interfaces.

<h3><a name="Previewer_X"></a>Previewers for X Windows</h3>

<p>
We know of three freely available X Windows screen previewers based on
Ghostscript: <b><tt>Ghostview</tt></b>, <b><tt>gv</tt></b>, and
<b><tt>GSPreview</tt></b>.  Most users who have expressed an opinion prefer
<b><tt>gv</tt></b> over <b><tt>Ghostview</tt></b>.

<dl>
<dt><b><tt>gv</tt></b>
<dd>gv, which is derived from Ghostview, is available from CTAN sites and

CompuServe announced in December 1995 that the Graphics Support Forum
offers Message Section and Library 21, "Ghostscript", for technical
assistance with Ghostscript.  Ghostscript is available for downloading in
Library 21, "Ghostscript." To access the Graphics Support Forum,
<b><tt>GO GRAPHSUP</tt></b>.  This service has no connection
with Aladdin Enterprises.

<p>
Aladdin Enterprises doesn't have the resources to respond to questions from
users of the freely available versions of Ghostscript.  (Responding to
questions and bug reports is one of the benefits that
<a href="#Commercial_use">Artifex Software</a> provides to commercial users
in exchange for the licensing fee.)  If you have problems with Ghostscript
and you have access to the Internet, we suggest to post your question to
one of these Usenet newsgroups:

<dl>
<dt><b><tt><a href="news:gnu.ghostscript.bug">gnu.ghostscript.bug</a></tt></b>
<dd>if your question is about <b>GNU Ghostscript</b> (currently versions
4.03 and below).  If you have access to Internet mail, but not Usenet news,
write to <b><tt>bug-ghostscript@gnu.org</tt></b>, which is equivalent to
posting to that newsgroup.

<dt><b><tt><a href="news:comp.lang.postscript">comp.lang.postscript</a></tt></b>
<dd>if your question is about <b>Aladdin Ghostscript</b> (currently
versions above 4.03).  If you have access to Internet mail, but not Usenet
news, write to <b><tt>comp.lang.postscript@aladdin.com</tt></b>, which is
equivalent to posting to that newsgroup.  We hope to establish a separate
newsgroup for Aladdin Ghostscript in the future, since
<b><tt>comp.lang.postscript</tt></b> was not intended for Ghostscript
discussion <em>per se</em>.
</dl>

<p>
There are hundreds of Ghostscript user sites all over the world, and
another user will often be able to help you.  If you have trouble with a
specific device driver, look at <b><tt>devs.mak</tt></b> and
<b><tt>contrib.mak</tt></b> in the Ghostscript source directory to see in
which file the driver is defined.  If it's defined in
<b><tt>contrib.mak</tt></b>, the list of contributed drivers, please
contact the author directly.  Aladdin Enterprises can't help you with
user-maintained drivers.

<h2><a name="Reporting_bugs"></a>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>
Aladdin Enterprises does want Ghostscript to be of high quality, so if you
have been running Ghostscript and encounter a problem, we encourage you to
post bugs to the newsgroups mentioned above.  Before doing that, however,
you should first check the "known bugs" notice at

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/relnotes/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/relnotes/</a>gs###/index.html
</blockquote>

<p>
where "###" is the unpunctuated version number of Ghostscript's latest
release.

<p>
We will consider investigating problems reported to those newsgroups, or
e-mailed directly to &lt;<a href="mailto:ghost@aladdin.com">ghost@aladdin.com</a>&gt;,
if (and only if) the report meets all the following conditions:

<ol>
<li>You are using the most recent version of Aladdin Ghostscript.

<li>You obtained Ghostscript directly from Aladdin Enterprises, or from the
<a href="#Find_Ghostscript">FTP or AFS site</a> on the Internet mentioned
above (that is, not from a bulletin board system or a commercial system
such as CompuServe).

<li>You have installed Ghostscript successfully, and used it successfully
on other input data.

<li>Your problem is reproducible, and you can provide the input data that
evokes it, either by e-mail in the problem report itself
(if data is less than 100K bytes) or by anonymous FTP or HTTP.

<li>Your problem is reproducible with Ghostscript alone, without using a
viewer such as Ghostview or GSview.  (If a problem happens only with
Ghostview, write to Tim Theisen
&lt;<a href="mailto:ghostview@cs.wisc.edu">ghostview@cs.wisc.edu</a>&gt;.
If it happens only with GSview, contact Russell Lang
&lt;<a href="mailto:rjl@aladdin.com">rjl@aladdin.com</a>&gt;.)

<li>You created the bug report by filling out the
<a href="Bug-form.htm">bug form</a> <em>completely</em>.  We really do
mean "<em>completely</em>" -- fill in every item that applies to your
situation.  To e-mail it, use your browser to save it as text, then
complete it and send the completed report.
</ol>

<p>
Bug reports that include suggested fixes are especially welcome.  As time
permits, Aladdin Enterprises may also respond to e-mail from the following
classes of users:

<ol>
<li>Beta testers who have actually given us at least one report on some
beta version supplied to them.

<li>People developing drivers for Ghostscript or applications based on it,
and that will be made freely available.

<li>People who express serious interest in
<a href="#Commercial_use">licensing Ghostscript commercially</a>.
</ol>

<p>
Aladdin Enterprises owns or has access to the following hardware and
software:

<ul>
<li> Pentium and 486 PCs with color SuperVGA displays; Epson-compatible
printer (the printer also is compatible with the IBM Proprinter); various
H-P printers.  These systems run MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.22 and Microsoft Windows
3.1 and 95 with Borland C++ 4.0 (and several older versions), Watcom C++
10.0, and Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0, and Linux with gcc

<li> SPARCstation, SunOS 4.1, cc and gcc, X11R5 and SunView; both
monochrome and color displays

<li> DECstation, Ultrix

<li> IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC, Unix (AIX 3.n)

<li> Alpha with Digital Unix
</ul>

<p>
If your problem turns out to be specific to some other hardware or
software configuration, it may take longer to track down, since we
will have to rely on other users to help.

<h1><a name="Aladdin"></a>Contacting Aladdin Enterprises</h1>

<p>
Please do not contact us if all you want is help with the freely
distributed versions of Ghostscript!  Ghostscript is free, but our time is
not.  If you call for help, we will tell you politely that we cannot answer
your question.  Ghostscript's documentation, while not of commercial
end-user quality, has been adequate for thousands of users (for many of
whom English is a foreign language), so the answer to your question is very
likely in it somewhere.

<h1><a name="How_to_help"></a>Things you can do to help</h1>

<p>
There are some projects that users could do that are somewhat independent
of the main body of the code, and that would help improve Ghostscript.

<ul>
<li>Make Ghostscript work with the free <b><tt>emx/gcc</tt></b> and
<b><tt>rsx</tt></b> libraries to provide an alternative DOS,
Windows 95/98/NT, and OS/2 implementation that requires no proprietary,
commercial compilers.  We think Ghostscript's existing OS/2 makefile already
includes most of what is needed.  If someone is willing to do the work, we
will be happy to include this in our list of supported platforms and to
distribute the makefiles.  If interested, please consult

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/">http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
and then <a href="#Aladdin">contact Aladdin</a> if you want to do the work.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We would like to provide (Adobe) PrintGear and (H-P) PPA output drivers
for Ghostscript, but the specifications for these protocols are not
published.  If you can provide them to us without violating any agreements,
please <a href="#Aladdin">contact Aladdin</a>.
</ul>
