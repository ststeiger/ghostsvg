These are the tools we use the do cluster-based regression testing.

The 'casper' directory contains a daemon that watches a queue directory 
filled in by svn post-commit hook scripts, and copies them to the 
corresponding queue on the cluster machines.

The 'tti' directory contains the daemons which launch regressions based 
on the queue files. Daemons can be launched interactively with no 
arguments, or with '-d start' and '-d stop' to run in the background,
detatched from any terminal.

This is not a live version of the source: commits here are not 
automatically picked up by the running system. This is more a
record of major code changes.
