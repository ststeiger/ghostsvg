== GhostPDL ==

This is an implemenation of several page description languages on
top of the Ghostscript graphics library.

Ghostscript PCL5e, PCL5c and PXL documentation is in doc/ghostpcl.*

=== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ===

If you are using GNU Make, a complete build can be generated by just
typing:

make

in the top level source directory. This will create three different 
builds. In main/obj/pcl6 a build of GhostPCL with support for PCL5e, 
PCL5c, and PXL. In language_switch/obj/pspcl6 a build of GhostPCL with 
additional support for PostScript and PDF. In xps/obj/gxps a build
with support for XPS.

===

The same executables can be built with Microsoft Visual C by running
the appropriate *_mvsc.mak file through nmake. For example:

cd xps
nmake -f xps_msvc.mak

or

cd main
nmake -f pcl6_msvc.mak

There is also an experimental solution file which builds GhostXPS
as xps\obj\gxps.exe.

The makefiles default to supporting MSVC 9 (2008 edition)
To use another  version, append it to the nmake command line,
for example:

cd main
nmake -f pcl6_msvc.mak MSVC_VERSION=6

===

To build just the xps interpreter with GNU make and gcc, type:

make xps

The executable will be xps/obj/gxps.

To build a shared language build with PCL/PXL and PostScript/PDF

make ls-product

The executable with be in language_switch/obj/pspcl6

===

Note for cygwin users

make CYGWIN=TRUE
make install

The CYGWIN variable will not include devices that depend on threads or
X11, neither are supported by the default cygwin system.

To build with a different font scaler use:

make PL_SCALER=afs ... # build using the Artifex Font scaler also the default.
make PL_SCALER=ufst ...# build with the AGFA Font Scaler.

We recommend doing a clean make prior to the changing the font scaler.

The default location for the fonts is /windows/fonts, but the current 
working directory is also searched. If the fonts are placed in another 
location the environment variable PCLFONTSOURCE must be set accordingly.  
See the documentation for more details.
